While the\ncurriculum for the first year is generally the same for all students, there are important variations. For example, some\nmajor programs require a full year of introductory chemistry; others do not. Students should become familiar with\nrequirements of those programs in which they have an interest and confer with their adviser at the time of\nenrollment and throughout the first year to plan a program of study that will keep options open as long as possible.\nSpecimen curricula for the engineering programs are given in the Courses of Study section. Requirements for the\nB.E. and B.S. degrees for the various programs vary in the minimum amount of hours and in specific course\nrequirements in the basic sciences and in mathematics.\nIncluded in the first year for all majors is the course Engineering Science 1401\u20131403 Introduction to Engineering,",

The program provides a strong engineering background centered on digital\ntechnology combined with an understanding of the principles and techniques of computer science. Computer\nengineering is design-oriented. The basic principles of engineering and computer science are applied to the task at\nhand, which may be the design of a digital processor, processor peripheral, or a complete digital processor-based\nsystem.\nPage 198 of 1019",

The minor is administered by the School of Engineering.\nNanoscience and nanotechnology are based on the ability to synthesize, organize, characterize, and manipulate\nmatter systematically at dimensions of ~1 to 100 nm, creating uniquely functional materials that differ in properties\nfrom those prepared by traditional approaches. At these length scales, materials can take on new properties that\ncan be exploited in a wide range of applications such as for solar energy conversion, ultra-sensitive sensing, and\nnew types of vaccines. These activities require the integration of expertise from various areas of science and\nengineering, often relying on methods of synthesis, fabrication, and characterization that are beyond those\nPage 435 of 1019",

Its core originates in the physical sciences by providing key approaches for describing the behavior of\nmatter on the nanoscale. Synthetic approaches are used to manipulate matter systematically, for creating uniquely\nfunctional nanomaterials that can be inorganic, organic, biological, or a hybrid of these. With a third component of\ncharacterization, a process for designing systems to have particular properties as a result of their composition and\nnanoscale arrangement emerges. Students are introduced to these areas through foundational and elective courses\nfor the minor that are specified below, the latter of which can be selected to fulfill the degree requirements for their\nmajor.\nThe minor in nanoscience and nanotechnology is supported by the Vanderbilt Institute of Nanoscale Science and",
