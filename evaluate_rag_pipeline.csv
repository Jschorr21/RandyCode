"What is the AXLE curriculum, and how does it apply to students in the College of Arts and Science?","AXLE (Achieving eXcellence in Liberal Education) is the general education curriculum for the College of Arts and Science. It is designed to provide students with a broad foundation of knowledge while allowing flexibility to explore their academic interests. The curriculum includes:

First-Year Writing Seminar (FYW): Required course in the first year
Writing Requirement: Additional coursework to strengthen writing skills
Liberal Arts Requirement (13 courses total): Distributed across six different areas of study including: Humanities and Creative Arts (HCA)
International Cultures (INT)
History and Culture of the United States (US)
Mathematics and Natural Sciences (MNS)
Social and Behavioral Sciences (SBS)
Perspectives (P)
Major Requirement: Students must declare a major and complete its specific coursework
AXLE ensures that students develop critical thinking, communication skills, and interdisciplinary knowledge, which are essential for any career path​."
What study abroad opportunities are available for Vanderbilt undergraduates?,"Vanderbilt offers a wide range of study abroad opportunities through its Global Education Office (GEO). These include:

Vanderbilt-Approved Programs: Students can choose from over 120 programs in 40+ countries
Semester, Yearlong, and Summer Programs: Options for different durations to fit student schedules
Immersion Vanderbilt: Some programs align with the Immersion requirement, allowing students to gain international experience as part of their academic program
Financial Aid and Credit Transfer: Many programs allow students to use their Vanderbilt financial aid, and courses often count toward their degree requirements
Students interested in studying abroad should meet with an academic adviser and GEO staff to ensure credits align with their major or minor​."
"What is Immersion Vanderbilt, and how does it impact graduation requirements?","Immersion Vanderbilt is an undergraduate program designed to enhance learning through hands-on, experiential opportunities. It is a graduation requirement for all Vanderbilt undergraduates, meaning each student must complete at least one immersive experience followed by a culminating project.

To fulfill the Immersion Vanderbilt requirement, students must engage in an immersive experience in one of six pathways:

Research
Study Abroad
Innovation, Arts, & Design
Civic & Community Engagement
Leadership & Professional Development
Internships

Each immersive experience must be mentored by a faculty or staff member and should encourage reflection on the student’s learning and goals.

After completing an immersive experience, students develop a culminating project, which can take various forms, such as presentations, performances, prototypes, or written reports. While students are encouraged to base their culminating project on their immersive experience, it is not required.

Once the faculty adviser approves the culminating project, the Immersion Vanderbilt requirement is marked as complete, and the student’s degree audit and transcript are updated with the project title and pathway.

Are there prerequisites for the Business Minor? ,"Three of the five mandatory courses in the undergraduate business minor require one of the following prerequisites, which may be completed in any order or simultaneously; Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) credit may be used to satisfy the Microeconomics and Statistics prerequisites.  1. Introductory Microeconomics: ECON 1020 2. Introductory Statistics: One of BME 2400, ECON 1500, ECON 1510, MATH 1010, MATH 1011, MATH 2810, MATH 2820, MATH 2821, PSY 2100, PSY-PC 2110, or SOC 2100"
Is it easy to double major in Computer Science and Mathematics at Vanderbilt?,"Yes, it is relatively feasible because both majors share a strong foundation in mathematics. Overlapping requirements like calculus, linear algebra, and discrete math help streamline the double major."
"What kind of student might benefit most from the Legal Studies minor at Vanderbilt, and how does it differ from a traditional pre-law track?","Students curious about law who want an academic edge before law school will benefit the most from this minor. Unlike informal pre-law advising, this minor offers student the opportunity to take actual law school courses and structured exposure to legal thinking."
What are the trade-offs between participating in a study abroad program versus an internship for fulfilling the Immersion Vanderbilt requirement?,Study abroad offers cultural immersion and global perspective; internships provide career experience and networking. Each has unique benefits depending on a student's goals and can fulfill the immersion requirement.
Can I take BUS 1100 and BUS 1300 at the same time?,"Yes, students may concurrently enroll in two of the five required half-semester courses for the Business minor, including BUS 1100 and BUS 1300."
How does Vanderbilt's policy handle AP or IB credit in satisfying prerequisites for Computer Science Majors?,"Vanderbilt University allows students to use AP and IB credit to satisfy certain prerequisites for the Computer Science major, depending on the specific exam and score received.

Accepted AP Exams for Computer Science:
AP Computer Science A: Score of 5 earns credit for CS 1101: Programming & Problem Solving (3 credit hours).

AP Computer Science Principles: Score of 5 earns credit for CS 1000: The Beauty and Joy of Computing (3 credit hours).

These credits may help students place out of introductory programming courses, allowing earlier access to advanced coursework. Note that for students in the School of Engineering, AP credit may count as open elective credit and not always substitute for core major requirements without adviser approval.

If you'd like to know whether you earn credit for a specific AP or IB exam, just ask — I'd be happy to check for you!"
I'm a sophomore planning to minor in Legal Studies and want to take a Criminal Law course. How can I do this,"You are eligible to take ULAW2380 - Criminal Law and Procedure as long as you’ve completed the required ULAW 1000: Introduction to American Law. This course focuses on the foundations of the criminal justice system, exploring criminal law, procedure, punishment, and systemic issues such as mass incarceration and racial disparities.. Courses in the Legal Studies minor are taught by Vanderbilt Law School faculty and are typically open to undergraduates pursuing the minor."
How does Army ROTC differ from Air Force ROTC?,"Army ROTC courses are taught on Vanderbilt’s campus and count toward elective credit in most schools.

Air Force ROTC is offered through Tennessee State University (TSU), and students must cross-enroll while still attending Vanderbilt. Credit for AFROTC courses may or may not transfer back for graduation depending on the course and school policies."
How many hours do I need to graduate from A&S,"Students must complete a minimum of 120 credit hours to graduate with a B.A. from the College of Arts and Science. This includes satisfying the AXLE requirements, the major, and any minors or electives."
When is Thanksgiving Break and graduation?,"Thanksgiving Break: Saturday, November 23 to Sunday, December 1, 2024

Commencement: Friday, May 9, 2025"
Why does Vanderbilt limit the number of credit hours that can be earned outside my home college,"Vanderbilt limits external credit hours to preserve the integrity of each college's degree program and ensure students receive a curriculum grounded in that college's academic philosophy. For example, the College of Arts & Science emphasizes a liberal education, so students must complete a majority of their coursework within that framework. This protects the coherence, depth, and accreditation of each program."
what does CS 3259 cover and are thre prerequisites?,"CS3259 - Computer Animation is an introduction to the core principles and techniques of computer animation. Topics covered include storyboarding, camera movement, skeletal systems, inverse kinematics, splines, keyframing, motion capture, dynamic simulation, particle systems, facial animation, and the perception of motion. Students collaborate in groups to design, model, animate, and render a complete computer animation project. The prerequisites for this course include MATH 2400, 2410, 2501, or 2600; CS 2201."
