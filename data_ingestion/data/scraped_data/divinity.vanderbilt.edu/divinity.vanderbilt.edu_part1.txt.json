As such, its history provides a distinct vantage point for viewing what has occurred in theological education since the latter part of the nineteenth century. History: The Divinity School began in 1875, following the 1873 founding of the University. It was established as the Biblical Department of Vanderbilt University and from its opening until May 1914 was under the auspices of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. Since that date it has carried on its work as an ecumenical theological school under direction of the Vanderbilt University Board of Trust. In 1915, by Board of Trust action, the Biblical Department became the Divinity School, with its own dean and faculty. For more than a century the school has graduated thousands who have carried on their ministries in all parts of this country and throughout the world. A new phase in the history of the Divinity School began in September 1966 with the moving of the Graduate School of Theology of Oberlin College to Vanderbilt. The growth of the faculty and the increase in financial resources resulting from this merger have made possible a broadening and strengthening of the school's academic programs and greater opportunities for service",

The growth of the faculty and the increase in financial resources resulting from this merger have made possible a broadening and strengthening of the school's academic programs and greater opportunities for service. The history of Vanderbilt Divinity School is recounted in a collected volume edited by Professor Emeritus and church historian Dale Johnson, Vanderbilt Divinity School: Education, Contest, and Change . Vanderbilt Divinity School: Education, Contest, and Change In this book, the contributors explore the school's history in terms of four main themes: Engagement with southern culture, present from the beginnings of the university but taking on special significance in the mid-twentieth century around the issue of race; The transition from an institution of the church (Methodist) to an independent and interdenominational school with a liberal Protestant orientation; The development of the modern research university, evident in the establishment of a graduate program in religion in addition to its program for the profession of ministry; From the 1950s, a growing concern with diversity and inclusivity, in keeping with national and international issues and developments both religious and cultural, which has broadened the school's sense of ecumenism and deepened its commitments to social justice",

Conflict has played an important part in shaping the history of the Vanderbilt Divinity School, from struggles over initial visions to questions of financial support and institutional control, from local debates over academic freedom to national issues of social justice. Especially noteworthy are the transformations the school has undergone since 1960: the \"James Lawson affair,\" where most of the divinity school faculty resigned over the expulsion of an African American graduate student who was organizing local lunch counter sit-ins; the impact of social change on the school since the late 1960s; and the contributions of women and African Americans, including their appointment to the faculty. Dale A. Johnson was professor emeritus of church history in the Divinity School at Vanderbilt University and author of The Changing Shape of English Nonconformity, 1825-1925 .

Vanderbilt University Divinity School offers four degrees, the Master of Divinity (M.Div.), the Master of Theological Studies (M.T.S), the Master of Theology (ThM), and the Doctor of Ministry (D.Min.) in Integrative Chaplaincy. Vanderbilt University Divinity School does not offer the M.A. or \u202fPh.D. Those degrees are offered in the Graduate Department of Religion. The Divinity School offers dual degree programs with Vanderbilt's Schools of Management, Education and Human Development, Law, Nursing and Medicine.

I\u2019ve never heard that language used for other graduate programs.\u201d An article in the November 2024 issue of Town & Country includes VDS on a short list of theological programs at Ivy and alt-Ivy universities attracting seasoned professionals in top-tier careers. While pausing one\u2019s career for graduate school might seem like a break, that does not describe the VDS experience. \u201cAttending VDS is not an intellectual rest, although we hope to provide \u2018balm\u2019 for those wrestling with difficult questions,\u201d Haynes said.

About 20 years ago she considered going to seminary, but stayed on the PhD path, earning a doctorate in American cultural studies from the University of Michigan. She joined the faculty at the University of Denver, where she weaved performance and visual arts into classes on African American literature. Hardin received tenure in 2019, but six months later the COVID pandemic required a quick pivot to online teaching. \u201cI had a family tragedy happening at the same time. All of that pressed in and really compelled me to ask what was going to be my legacy?

Through our various programming, we offer opportunities for students, staff and faculty at Vanderbilt\u2019s professional schools to develop their sense of professional vocation and ethical leadership.\u00a0 In addition, we offer programs for the general public on subjects related to moral leadership within the professions. These offerings include conversations on justice and the common good, on addressing ethical issues relevant to the professions, and on developing important skills for leadership, \u00a0including conflict management and transformation and leading change, trauma-informed leadership and the role of identity in the practice of ethical leadership.\u00a0 In these ways, the CTP seeks to equip professionals to be effective ethical leaders in challenging times",

This isn\u2019t necessarily intentional but reflects our own formation by the systems that gave rise to these biases. Ellen T. Armour, Seeing and Believing: Religion, Digital Visual Culture, and Social Justice (2023) Imagine looking into a mirror and finally seeing your reflection for the first time. Now: imagine that you\u2019re looking into what you thought was a mirror, but instead you realize that it\u2019s a window. A window through which you see others, perhaps for the first time as well. Most windows still hold a bit of our own reflections, too, depending upon how the light dances on the surface. The documentary film Wonderfully Made: LGBTQ+ R(eligion) delivers an artful take on the interplay of themes and questions related to imagination, perception, reflection. A central focus of the film is how LGBTQIA+ Roman Catholics have been engaging in the difficult but necessary work of seeing themselves as included in a tradition that, in large part, has either denied the validity of their being or condemned their sexualities and gender identities",

        "text": ". On October 10, in celebration of National Coming Out Day, Vanderbilt hosted two events related to the film: a workshop in which the director, Yuval David, discussed \u201cstorytelling as social change,\u201d and a screening of the film paired with a panel discussion and showing of the photo art at the Vanderbilt Fine Arts Gallery. In the workshop, David stressed that art can be a tool for advocacy and social change, and that there is a need for \u201ccompassionate curiosity\u201d that helps us live into the stories of those who are different than us. As a filmmaker and artist, David maintains that encouraging both compassion and curiosity, spurred by artistic vision and implementation, can help increase inclusion, mutual understanding, and social change. How can \u201ccompassionate curiosity\u201d be encouraged? What would it mean to see ourselves? And what does it mean to see others, as holistic beings of value \u2013 in the fullness of their sexual and gender identities? How might LGBTQIA+ Roman Catholics (and even Protestant and Orthodox Christians) envisage themselves as a loved and accepted part of Christian traditions, despite the lack of positive iconography and relative paucity of theological affirmation (of our worth)? As the narrative of Wonderfully Made suggests, LGBTQIA+ Roman Catholics have rarely \u2013 if ever \u2013 been able to see who they are and whom they love reflected in a positive way from the standpoint of their religious tradition",

They must redact significant pieces of their lived experiences to understand themselves as accepted by the Church, and implicitly, as accepted by the God imagined and embraced by Christian theological traditions. The film specifically emphasizes that this theological and social redaction is reinforced by traditional iconography related to the figure of Jesus Christ. The photo art produced in the making of the film, then, addresses this lack by creating new icons of Christ\u2019s life and passion narrative, with LGBTQIA+ persons portraying Jesus Christ, draped in rainbow garments and, in some photos, emblazoned with a rainbow sacred heart. The LGBTQIA+ icons are revealed at the end of the film, with no voiceover or explanation, just soft, ethereal tones that suggest the gravity of what the viewer is seeing. The filmmakers \u2013 and the actors, who served as the models for the photoshoot \u2013 articulate a shared hope that LGBTQIA+ Roman Catholics will see themselves reflected back, perhaps for the first time, through these diverse images of Jesus Christ. And further, that those beyond the LGBTQ+ community might see and recognize the image of God as reflected by those who are trans, nonbinary, gay, lesbian, bisexual, pansexual, intersex, and the whole host of diverse, prismatic beauty represented by LGBTQIA+ persons. Perhaps for the first time as well",

As we come to the close of LGBTQ History month, my own hope is that LGBTQIA+ persons will feel affirmed and encouraged to be who we are, and significantly, to know that our embodiment and presence is part of (divine) creation. We have been here since the emergence of Christian traditions, and we will continue to witness to the truth of our creation and worth, into the future. We live, move, and have our being in this world, and we are part of the diversity of a creation that is vibrant and good. LGBTQIA+ persons are more than capable of embodying and reflecting Jesus Christ, through the medium of iconography; and what Wonderfully Made suggests is that seeing this reflected through photo art may help all of us believe \u2013 and feel \u2013 it to be true. -Rachel A.

When faced with expansive debates and diverse lived experiences, how can one claim to be in possession of the absolute truth? Belief It is a tautology to say that everyone believes something. It is also unhelpful, even if it is true. The better question is what one believes and what its effect is on oneself and on others. Fundamentalism of any sort, for example, can easily become problematic in multiple ways, but in itself it does not need to be oppressive. The problem comes, however, if absolutism about a belief is interjected. Absolutists exclude all scrutiny and debate from discussion, and other options, regardless of their weight and cogency, become anathema, detested, and dismissed. Moreover, the believer in this case presumes a level of superiority and authority over others, willing to marginalize and denigrate them and in extreme instances even to incarcerate or kill them. Beliefs are sometimes labeled as \u201cdeeply held\u201d as if that were enough to legitimate them, even though such a characterization may actually mask the insidious, harmful effect of trenchant opinions",

Beliefs are sometimes labeled as \u201cdeeply held\u201d as if that were enough to legitimate them, even though such a characterization may actually mask the insidious, harmful effect of trenchant opinions. A key part of maturation is learning to tolerate and accept difference, which includes decreasing one\u2019s self-assurance that one particular belief is better than another. Such acceptance is a counterpart to empathy, which can start to appear in rudimentary form during a child\u2019s early years but then around age five or six usually begins to blossom into a more subtle form of reasoning and understanding of others. This trait matures throughout adolescence and even into early adulthood. Unfortunately, some adults scarcely exhibit empathy at all, especially in pathological cases of criminality or exploitation. Our observations of people with little or no empathy prompt us\u2014or at least should prompt us\u2014to examine our own judgments and our self-confidence, to ensure that we respect the rights of others to hold opinions of their own. This applies to all manner of issues\u2014life choices, political values, gender options, consumerism, career moves, educational opportunities, and much more. And it certainly figures into the world of ideas, ideologies, and beliefs. A wide range of options exists in each of these areas, choices that we all make personally and with stimulation from the thoughts and actions of others, not the least through close and meaningful association with select others",

Beliefs are subject to the vagaries and complexities of life, many out of our control. We may be born into a loving and supportive family or one that is abusive and violent. We may enjoy plenty or suffer hunger and want. We may benefit from good health and strength or experience disability and physical limitations. We may be free from disaster or be struck by a devastating, life-changing accident. We may be raised a Hindu, Buddhist, Muslim, Christian, or any of thousands of other religious variations. In all such cases we are not creators of our circumstances, whether they be good or bad. As much as we may wish to think of ourselves as the determiners of our fate, much lies outside our control. Of course, we are responsible for how we react to our given state of affairs, including the notions or ideas we hold about life and the world. Here is where belief, doubt, disbelief, and non-belief come into play. They all can coexist as viable responses to human existence and conditions.

And all, we must acknowledge, are opinions, not facts or irrefutable evidence or absolute truths. The general comments made here need to be anchored in specifics, and I will do so with some autobiographical reflections about my own personal experiences and the evolution of my thinking about this topic, especially in light of the role and nature of religious thought. I was born in 1943 into a supportive family that sought to give my three siblings and me many opportunities and encouragement to be productive and happy in life. I should say, though, that our parents\u2019 horizons were confined to quite traditional Christian options. While both of them had a university education and our father even earned a doctoral degree, they encouraged us to attend Christian colleges, which we all did except for our youngest brother. Our father was a minister in the American Baptist Convention, a denomination that is not as conservative and dogmatic as the larger Southern Baptist Convention. The latter had formed in 1845 because of its support of slavery, which the Baptists in the northern U.S. firmly opposed. The Southern Baptists also subscribe now to such principles as the inerrancy of the Bible, the belief in personal salvation in order to enter heaven and avoid eternity in hell, and such social positions as forbidding women to become clergy and condemning same-sex relationships",

Like other American Baptists, our parents promoted social justice and diversity, grounding them theologically in the teachings of the Bible; such veneration of the Bible is quite commonplace in the Baptist tradition. All four of us siblings followed our parents in some of these more liberal social principles, but we all started to break away from their strictnessduring our university years, if not even before. In general, they instilled in all four of us siblings a set of values: a deep concern for the wellbeing of others; a sense of equality among races, genders, and peoples; a drive for knowledge instead of material acquisitions; a commitment to family and friends; an appreciation for music, art, and literature; an intrigue with cultural differences around the world; a love of travel; and a healthy work ethic. These are not beliefs as such, but more on the order of coordinates, points for orientation and action. None of us, though, carried forward our parents\u2019 religiosity. Read the whole article here.

The PIR host sessions about their work, mentor students and invite them to visit their organization or congregation. Students will be exposed to experts who model the interdisciplinary, interfaith and justice work that is at the core of the Vanderbilt Divinity School community. \u201cWhen I first started teaching, most of my students were headed into congregational ministry,\u201d Dean Yolanda Pierce said. \u201cToday, students are finding many more pathways to live out their vocational calling. The practitioner-in-residence program will help students better discern the many doors their VDS degree can open while strengthening relationships with community partners.\u201d VDS is excited that Rev.

Intersex people are born with differences in sex traits or reproductive anatomy. The phenomenon is as common as having red hair or green eyes, affecting almost 2 percent of the population. Lin Morales, a junior in the College of Arts and Science and co-president of the Vanderbilt Lambda Association, helped organize what he hopes will become an annual event. He was inspired by a course he took called Intersex in Christian Traditions: Perspectives from Science, Law, Culture and Theology, taught by the Divinity School\u2019s Stephanie Budwey . \u201cOur class had amazing discussions that increased my understanding about the challenges for intersex people,\u201d said Morales, who is majoring in political science and studio art with a minor in religious studies. \u201cI\u2019m trans myself and found many connections between trans and intersex and other gender identities",

There were also three speakers from interACT, a national advocacy organization for intersex youth: Bria Brown-King, Maddie Moran and Marissa Adams. Jeremy Brooks McKinnon led a reflection following the screening of the narrative short film As Common as Red Hair and the new documentary Every Body . Brooks McKinnon\u00a0 is a master of divinity candidate who is completing his final semester. Morales emphasized that the speaker series has set a precedent for intersex advocacy in the future, with plans underway to hold another campus event next year. He had reached out to Budwey last spring about bringing together people and resources from across campus to increase awareness and knowledge on intersex issues. \u201cLin was moved and energized to begin planning for an event in October,\u201d said Budwey, author of Religion and Intersex: Perspectives from Science, Law, Culture and Theology . \u201cThe reality is that many folks do not know what intersex is or have a grave misunderstanding about the definition",

Rather than embracing that diversity, individuals are forced to feel very shameful about their bodies.\u201d Budwey noted that infants and young children around the world have undergone medically unnecessary surgeries to try to fit them into certain understandings about sex and gender, and there can be severe repercussions. The Intersex Awareness Speaker Series is co-sponsored by the Carpenter Program in Religion, Gender and Sexuality and its Queer Faith, Policy and Liberation Cohort; Vanderbilt Lambda Association; LGTBQ+ Policy Lab; K.C. Potter Center for LGTBQI Life; and Religion in the Arts and Contemporary Culture program. \u201cWe hope to create more welcoming spaces, awareness and knowledge about gender and sexual identities, and to highlight those in order to bring greater inclusion and belonging to our world,\u201d said Rachel Heath, assistant director of the Carpenter program.

Carter Ellis, MDiv, \u201913, was selected as a delegate to the UMC General Conference, which took place April 3 \u2013 May 3 in Charlotte, North Carolina. \u201cThe goal for us who support LGBTQIA+ inclusion was to get to \u2018neutral,\u2019 so to speak, with UMC policies,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cWe succeeded in removing harmful language, and in one or two instances, add protections for queer clergy, but it is by no means yet an explicitly inclusive policy.\u201d With the approved changes, United Methodist pastors can no longer be punished for performing weddings of same-sex couples. Queer clergy are able to go through the ordination process while being open about their sexual orientation or gender identity. Those ministers who had their credentials removed for being queer can apply to have them reinstated. Ellis, who was skeptical about the church when she enrolled at the Divinity School, is grateful for witness from Divinity School faculty and staff who normalized what being queer and called to love and serve looks like. \u201cWe don\u2019t see that witness very often in the church,\u201d Ellis said",

She was ordained as an elder in 2017. Three years later she moved to Kansas City and took the courageous step of marriage with Lora Andrews, MDiv\u201914. \u201cWe were immediately placed under complaint through the denomination, which could have been processed toward losing our credentials,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cOur bishops held us in what\u2019s called \u2018abeyance\u2019 while we waited and prayed for changes in the Book of Discipline. If the delegates at the General Conference had not voted the way they did, we could have faced a trial to decide if we could continue being clergy. Our careers have been defined by this work for justice.\u201d Andrews, an ordained elder in the Great Plains (Kansas and Nebraska) Conference, attended this spring\u2019s UMC General Conference as a member of its Queer Clergy Caucus and as a chaplain. She has advocated for removing discriminatory language targeting LGBTQIA+ clergy from UMC policies since her student days. Religion and Social Movements, a course taught by C. Melissa Snarr , the E.

A decade later, I continue to apply what I learned in school to my ministry.\u201d Also attending the conference was Eric Burton-Krieger, MDiv\u201911, who is transitioning his ministry from Indianapolis to Atlanta, Georgia. In 2007, he was selected for the first class of the Cal Turner Leadership Scholars program, which supported master of divinity candidates pursuing UMC ministry. Burton-Krieger enrolled at Vanderbilt because he wanted an academically rigorous education. However, being part of a deeply supportive community was an additional benefit. \u201cOrganizing for justice is hard work, and it\u2019s taken decades in our denomination.

Burton-Krieger noted the influence of alumni/ae serving at Nashville area churches like Edgehill United Methodist and East End United Methodist. \u201cThey would share their Vanderbilt experiences with us students, but also talk about the impact of activism in their daily lives post-graduation,\u201d he said. Brandon Baxter, MDiv\u201917, senior pastor at East End United Methodist Church, credits his Divinity School education for helping navigate power dynamics and relationships within the denomination.

Melissa Snarr , program director and associate professor of ethics and society. Vanderbilt\u2019s doctor of ministry in integrative chaplaincy is a six-semester hybrid program with a deep commitment to equip VA and military chaplains, as well as other institutional chaplains, with evidence-based practices of care. \u201cMilitary and institutional chaplains are needed more than ever on the front lines of mental health care,\u201d said Snarr, who also holds the E.

She and Keith G.

He was recently redeployed with the USS Leyte Gulf , a guided missile cruiser, and is grateful to be able to work on his research project while being deployed. \u201cTo write for my research is a wonderful blessing, helping me decompress from any stresses I have during my limited free time on the ship,\u201d Terrell said. \u201cAs a military chaplain, I often counsel people on a variety of bad experiences, serving more than 300 people on this vessel.\u201d He is developing a small-group model for what he calls \u201cdeconstructing unhelpful Christian theology and at the same time helping those persons reconstruct a more authentic Christian identity.\u201d Terrell is using the tools that come out of acceptance and commitment therapy to help create that small-group space. \u201cThe doctor of ministry program has given me skills that enable me to do more than listen and pray. Listening and prayer are wonderful practices, but it\u2019s so helpful to be able to offer more to those in crisis,\u201d he said. Also from Pensacola, Florida, is Lt. Cmdr",

Laura Palmer, a Navy chaplain who is based in North Carolina. She has begun her fourth semester in the doctoral program. \u201cLearning alongside chaplains from various settings has fostered insightful conversations and afforded opportunities to further explore and give voice to the \u2018whys and hows\u2019 of the care we can provide,\u201d Palmer said. \u201cThe focus on collaboration with mental health practitioners\u2014learning their language and utilizing different modalities\u2014dovetails into building spiritual readiness. That is the strength of spirit that enables the warfighter to accomplish the mission with honor. And the opportunity to engage with chaplains from the VA and other contexts has reaffirmed for me the care that is extended through the seasons of a service member\u2019s life.\u201d For her doctor of ministry project, she wants to explore how spirituality and its neural effects might serve as a protective factor and offer steps toward hope and healing in response to the neurobiological overlaps found in shame and suicidality. The Divinity School currently enrolls more active military and veterans than all the other nine schools of the university combined, with 19 of the 26 2023 graduating doctor of ministry students (the first graduating class) being military members and veterans",

His dedication to justice began early in his career, when he was licensed to the ministry in 1988 and ordained in 1990, serving local parishes such as Zion United Church of Christ in Henderson, Kentucky, where he transformed a small congregation into a vibrant, multiracial, open and affirming community of over 300 members. From 1992\u20132000, Dr. Guess was among the earliest openly gay clergy in the UCC\u2019s Indiana-Kentucky Conference. His pastoral work continued in Kentucky in 1994, where he led one of the state\u2019s first openly affirming congregations. Dr. Guess has also been deeply involved in various justice initiatives, co-founding the Kentucky Fairness Campaign, the state\u2019s leading LGBTQ advocacy organization. He broadened his efforts to health services, leading the initiative to open an on-site Planned Parenthood clinic at his church and co-founded Matthew 25 AIDS Services, one of the largest nonprofit health service providers for individuals with HIV in Kentucky. Over the past 36 years, Dr. Guess has built an impressive career in ordained ministry and organizational leadership within the UCC and nonprofit sectors. Dr. Guess established monumental precedent as the first openly LGBTQ+ individual elected to serve as a national officer and executive minister of the denomination",

Throughout his career, Dr. Guess has authored numerous articles and op-eds and has been an advocate for racial, social, gender and economic justice. Dr. Guess has also served on numerous boards, including the National LGBTQ Task Force, National Jobs With Justice, the Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland and many more. Beyond his ministry work, Dr. Guess has served in multiple capacities as a national director within the UCC, including as director of communications, identity and publications and editor of United Church News, where Dr. Guess advocated and editorialized for the importance of an independent church press, free from editorial oversight of denominational executives. During his tenure, he played an instrumental role in advancing media justice and religious freedom, culminating in his role as lead spokesperson for UCC v. Cooper , the historic case which brought marriage equality to North Carolina in 2014, and eventually the entire U.S. Fourth Circuit.

Under his leadership, the organization advances political participation, voting rights, criminal legal system reform, personal autonomy, dignity and greater inclusion and belonging for all Ohioans. Most recently, he played a leading role in Ohio\u2019s November 2023 ballot campaign, which successfully safeguarded abortion rights and reproductive freedom. Currently, he is integral to Ohio\u2019s campaign to end gerrymandering through the creation of a new citizen-led Independent Redistricting Commission. Reflecting on his impactful career, Dr. Guess\u2019 academic rigor, theological insight and passion for social justice have profoundly shaped his vocation. His legacy is an ongoing testament to Vanderbilt Divinity School\u2019s mission of fostering transformative leaders who live out their values in service to justice and equity. His work continues to inspire future faith leaders and advocates committed to making lasting change. Williamson has dedicated his life to justice, ethics and advocacy through ministry and scholarship. Dr. Williamson\u2019s early commitment to social justice can be traced back to his undergraduate years, where he was among the students from Wake Forest and Winston-Salem State University who took part in the historic Greensboro and Winston-Salem lunch counter sit-ins of 1960",

These momentous sit-ins launched a critical student leadership movement, with the sit-ins sweeping across the nation as students protested segregated lunch counters and other public spaces, with many white students joining the effort. The sit-ins Dr. Williamson took part in also included several arrests, and attracted widespread media attention to the issue of segregation. On February 23, 1960, a Winston-Salem sit-in marked a milestone as the first to include white participants\u2014among them, ten students from Wake Forest, including Dr. Williamson. With twenty individuals, both black and white, standing together, this gathering became the first sit-in to result in arrests, including Dr. Williamson, establishing a powerful precedent just days before the Nashville sit-ins led by Rev. James Lawson. The sit-in ultimately led to the desegregation of the city\u2019s restaurants and lunch counters just three months later, making it the first successful sit-in protest in North Carolina. As a doctoral candidate, Dr. Williamson was appointed chaplain and associate professor of religion at Vassar College, where he served and taught for over a decade, instilling in students a commitment to social justice and ethical leadership until 1981. He was also a member of the Science, Technology and Society Program and the American Culture multi-disciplinary programs at Vassar, where his leadership ultimately led them to divest from South Africa.

Dr. Williamson then returned to pastoral work, where he was called to serve as pastor of First Baptist Church of Granville, Ohio, now known as The United Church of Granville. During his tenure, he led FBC Granville to be Welcoming and Affirming and presented and advocated for LGBTQ issues before the denomination. At the time, FBC Granville was the only place for gay weddings and ordinations in the area. Under Dr. Williamson\u2019s leadership, the church also became headquarters for Habitat for Humanity and an AIDS Task Force. Additionally, FBC Granville was part of the Sanctuary Movement, a political and religious campaign that emerged in the early 1980s, dedicated to offering safe haven for Central American refugees. These efforts were not without challenge, as they faced fierce opposition from those opposed to LGBTQ rights and sanctuary practices. The church\u2019s Feminist Sunday School class played a pivotal role in the organization Women Have Options , providing essential support to women who faced barriers to accessing abortion services. In the mid-1980s, the church also contributed to the historic Gang Summit , a groundbreaking peace gathering in St. Louis that brought together gang leaders from across the country in the pursuit of nonviolent solutions",

In 1984, Dr. Williamson, with other peacemakers, founded the Baptist Peace Fellowship of North America, an organization devoted to peace and reconciliation, where he served as the founding president. Dr. Williamson played a key role in organizing and leading the founding meeting of the BPFNA. Notably, Dr. Williamson represented BPFNA, now known as BPFNA ~ Bautistas por la Paz , on a peace mission to Iraq one month before the first Iraq War. During the Contra War, FBC Granville, in collaboration with the BPFNA, purchased a school bus, stocked it with essential food and medicine, and sent it to Nicaragua. Two families from the congregation undertook the journey, delivering aid to support the work of Gustavo Parajon, a former student pastor who was engaged in critical medical and agricultural work in the Nicaraguan jungles.
