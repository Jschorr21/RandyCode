As such, its history provides a distinct vantage point for viewing what has occurred in theological education since the latter part of the nineteenth century. History: The Divinity School began in 1875, following the 1873 founding of the University. It was established as the Biblical Department of Vanderbilt University and from its opening until May 1914 was under the auspices of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. Since that date it has carried on its work as an ecumenical theological school under direction of the Vanderbilt University Board of Trust. In 1915, by Board of Trust action, the Biblical Department became the Divinity School, with its own dean and faculty. For more than a century the school has graduated thousands who have carried on their ministries in all parts of this country and throughout the world. A new phase in the history of the Divinity School began in September 1966 with the moving of the Graduate School of Theology of Oberlin College to Vanderbilt. The growth of the faculty and the increase in financial resources resulting from this merger have made possible a broadening and strengthening of the school's academic programs and greater opportunities for service",

The growth of the faculty and the increase in financial resources resulting from this merger have made possible a broadening and strengthening of the school's academic programs and greater opportunities for service. The history of Vanderbilt Divinity School is recounted in a collected volume edited by Professor Emeritus and church historian Dale Johnson, Vanderbilt Divinity School: Education, Contest, and Change . Vanderbilt Divinity School: Education, Contest, and Change In this book, the contributors explore the school's history in terms of four main themes: Engagement with southern culture, present from the beginnings of the university but taking on special significance in the mid-twentieth century around the issue of race; The transition from an institution of the church (Methodist) to an independent and interdenominational school with a liberal Protestant orientation; The development of the modern research university, evident in the establishment of a graduate program in religion in addition to its program for the profession of ministry; From the 1950s, a growing concern with diversity and inclusivity, in keeping with national and international issues and developments both religious and cultural, which has broadened the school's sense of ecumenism and deepened its commitments to social justice",

Conflict has played an important part in shaping the history of the Vanderbilt Divinity School, from struggles over initial visions to questions of financial support and institutional control, from local debates over academic freedom to national issues of social justice. Especially noteworthy are the transformations the school has undergone since 1960: the \"James Lawson affair,\" where most of the divinity school faculty resigned over the expulsion of an African American graduate student who was organizing local lunch counter sit-ins; the impact of social change on the school since the late 1960s; and the contributions of women and African Americans, including their appointment to the faculty. Dale A. Johnson was professor emeritus of church history in the Divinity School at Vanderbilt University and author of The Changing Shape of English Nonconformity, 1825-1925 .

Vanderbilt University Divinity School does not offer the M.A. or  Ph.D. Those degrees are offered in the Graduate Department of Religion. The Divinity School offers dual degree programs with Vanderbilt's Schools of Management, Education and Human Development, Law, Nursing and Medicine. The current site of the Vanderbilt University Divinity School is not its first location on campus. The first Divinity building, Wesley Hall, burned to the ground in 1932. Before moving to its current site in 1960, the Divinity School was located across 21st Avenue in the current location of Wesley Place garage.",

I’ve never heard that language used for other graduate programs.” An article in the November 2024 issue of Town & Country includes VDS on a short list of theological programs at Ivy and alt-Ivy universities attracting seasoned professionals in top-tier careers. While pausing one’s career for graduate school might seem like a break, that does not describe the VDS experience. “Attending VDS is not an intellectual rest, although we hope to provide ‘balm’ for those wrestling with difficult questions,” Haynes said. Tayana Hardin: Black literature scholar thrives at VDS Tayana Hardin took a leave of absence from the University of Denver, where she was an associate professor of African American literature, to enroll at VDS in fall 2023. After two successful semesters as a master of divinity student, Hardin resigned from her professorship",

    "text": ". After two successful semesters as a master of divinity student, Hardin resigned from her professorship. “Every day I wake up knowing that this is the best decision I could have made for myself,” Hardin said. About 20 years ago she considered going to seminary, but stayed on the PhD path, earning a doctorate in American cultural studies from the University of Michigan. She joined the faculty at the University of Denver, where she weaved performance and visual arts into classes on African American literature. Hardin received tenure in 2019, but six months later the COVID pandemic required a quick pivot to online teaching. “I had a family tragedy happening at the same time. All of that pressed in and really compelled me to ask what was going to be my legacy? What would I leave behind?” Hardin is on track to graduate in 2026. “From my professorial perspective, I’ve enjoyed seeing how African American literature plays into thinking theologically about the Black experience,” Hardin said. “I’ve had VDS courses that use African American fiction to represent experience, and as a way to then catapult us into asking ethical questions—theological questions—about the Black self in a larger white and American society",

I’m excited to see how literature plays an influential role in the work of scholars who focus on the Black religious experience in the United States.” Hardin has fully embraced her field education at the Frist Art Museum, where she is engaged with programs that are public facing and arts forward. “It is exciting to see what teaching looks like when students range in age from pre-k to 80s,” she said. “I am intrigued with the idea of bringing together some kind of work in spiritual care with the arts.” Graeme Dennis: Consultant to biopharma finds VDS ‘life changing’ As a Vanderbilt undergraduate, Graeme Dennis, BS’99, was on an atypical path for theological education. He earned a bachelor of science in chemistry and spent the next five years as a teaching fellow at Harvard University. Then he went to work at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where he was the scientific informatics lead for the Program in Drug Discovery. After holding key positions at three software companies, Dennis became an independent consultant to biopharma in scientific informatics strategy. “I loved the teaching, learning and problem-solving that working with pharma required, and it took me around the world, too.“ Dennis said",

Continuing and executive education are excellent options for adult learners not seeking a degree,” according to Nathan Cost, associate director of VDS Lifelong Learning. “We are building out new courses and embedding certificate programs into the curriculum,” Cost said. “A few decades ago this access to divinity classes did not exist.” While the median age for a VDS student is 27, there’s a wide age span in the classes—from 20s to 80s. “Even with age and other demographic differences, our students find they share more similarities than differences,” Cost said. “We welcome those striving to become ‘whole’ through theological education, whether they are preparing to work in a religious institution or not,” said Yolanda Pierce , dean of Vanderbilt Divinity School and holder of the Cornelius Vanderbilt Chair in Religion and Literature. “Knowing that lifelong learners never stop discerning and growing, we are committed to their success.” VDS Voices Vds voices",

Through our various programming, we offer opportunities for students, staff and faculty at Vanderbilt’s professional schools to develop their sense of professional vocation and ethical leadership.  In addition, we offer programs for the general public on subjects related to moral leadership within the professions. These offerings include conversations on justice and the common good, on addressing ethical issues relevant to the professions, and on developing important skills for leadership,  including conflict management and transformation and leading change, trauma-informed leadership and the role of identity in the practice of ethical leadership.  In these ways, the CTP seeks to equip professionals to be effective ethical leaders in challenging times",

This isn’t necessarily intentional but reflects our own formation by the systems that gave rise to these biases. Ellen T. Armour, Seeing and Believing: Religion, Digital Visual Culture, and Social Justice (2023) Imagine looking into a mirror and finally seeing your reflection for the first time. Now: imagine that you’re looking into what you thought was a mirror, but instead you realize that it’s a window. A window through which you see others, perhaps for the first time as well. Most windows still hold a bit of our own reflections, too, depending upon how the light dances on the surface. The documentary film Wonderfully Made: LGBTQ+ R(eligion) delivers an artful take on the interplay of themes and questions related to imagination, perception, reflection. A central focus of the film is how LGBTQIA+ Roman Catholics have been engaging in the difficult but necessary work of seeing themselves as included in a tradition that, in large part, has either denied the validity of their being or condemned their sexualities and gender identities",

    "text": ". On October 10, in celebration of National Coming Out Day, Vanderbilt hosted two events related to the film: a workshop in which the director, Yuval David, discussed “storytelling as social change,” and a screening of the film paired with a panel discussion and showing of the photo art at the Vanderbilt Fine Arts Gallery. In the workshop, David stressed that art can be a tool for advocacy and social change, and that there is a need for “compassionate curiosity” that helps us live into the stories of those who are different than us. As a filmmaker and artist, David maintains that encouraging both compassion and curiosity, spurred by artistic vision and implementation, can help increase inclusion, mutual understanding, and social change. How can “compassionate curiosity” be encouraged? What would it mean to see ourselves? And what does it mean to see others, as holistic beings of value – in the fullness of their sexual and gender identities? How might LGBTQIA+ Roman Catholics (and even Protestant and Orthodox Christians) envisage themselves as a loved and accepted part of Christian traditions, despite the lack of positive iconography and relative paucity of theological affirmation (of our worth)? As the narrative of Wonderfully Made suggests, LGBTQIA+ Roman Catholics have rarely – if ever – been able to see who they are and whom they love reflected in a positive way from the standpoint of their religious tradition",

They must redact significant pieces of their lived experiences to understand themselves as accepted by the Church, and implicitly, as accepted by the God imagined and embraced by Christian theological traditions. The film specifically emphasizes that this theological and social redaction is reinforced by traditional iconography related to the figure of Jesus Christ. The photo art produced in the making of the film, then, addresses this lack by creating new icons of Christ’s life and passion narrative, with LGBTQIA+ persons portraying Jesus Christ, draped in rainbow garments and, in some photos, emblazoned with a rainbow sacred heart. The LGBTQIA+ icons are revealed at the end of the film, with no voiceover or explanation, just soft, ethereal tones that suggest the gravity of what the viewer is seeing. The filmmakers – and the actors, who served as the models for the photoshoot – articulate a shared hope that LGBTQIA+ Roman Catholics will see themselves reflected back, perhaps for the first time, through these diverse images of Jesus Christ. And further, that those beyond the LGBTQ+ community might see and recognize the image of God as reflected by those who are trans, nonbinary, gay, lesbian, bisexual, pansexual, intersex, and the whole host of diverse, prismatic beauty represented by LGBTQIA+ persons. Perhaps for the first time as well",

As we come to the close of LGBTQ History month, my own hope is that LGBTQIA+ persons will feel affirmed and encouraged to be who we are, and significantly, to know that our embodiment and presence is part of (divine) creation. We have been here since the emergence of Christian traditions, and we will continue to witness to the truth of our creation and worth, into the future. We live, move, and have our being in this world, and we are part of the diversity of a creation that is vibrant and good. LGBTQIA+ persons are more than capable of embodying and reflecting Jesus Christ, through the medium of iconography; and what Wonderfully Made suggests is that seeing this reflected through photo art may help all of us believe – and feel – it to be true. -Rachel A.

    "text": "Belief in Non-Belief Sep 22, 2023, 8:52 PM Twitter Facebook Email LinkedIn Here is the beginning of  Professor Douglas Knight’s most recent article: Raised in a Baptist family that valued diversity and social justice, educated during the 1960s period of anti-war student unrest, Vanderbilt Divinity School professor emeritus reflects on higher education, critical thinking, and belief. When faced with expansive debates and diverse lived experiences, how can one claim to be in possession of the absolute truth? Belief It is a tautology to say that everyone believes something. It is also unhelpful, even if it is true. The better question is what one believes and what its effect is on oneself and on others. Fundamentalism of any sort, for example, can easily become problematic in multiple ways, but in itself it does not need to be oppressive. The problem comes, however, if absolutism about a belief is interjected. Absolutists exclude all scrutiny and debate from discussion, and other options, regardless of their weight and cogency, become anathema, detested, and dismissed. Moreover, the believer in this case presumes a level of superiority and authority over others, willing to marginalize and denigrate them and in extreme instances even to incarcerate or kill them. Beliefs are sometimes labeled as “deeply held” as if that were enough to legitimate them, even though such a characterization may actually mask the insidious, harmful effect of trenchant opinions",

    "text": ". Beliefs are sometimes labeled as “deeply held” as if that were enough to legitimate them, even though such a characterization may actually mask the insidious, harmful effect of trenchant opinions. A key part of maturation is learning to tolerate and accept difference, which includes decreasing one’s self-assurance that one particular belief is better than another. Such acceptance is a counterpart to empathy, which can start to appear in rudimentary form during a child’s early years but then around age five or six usually begins to blossom into a more subtle form of reasoning and understanding of others. This trait matures throughout adolescence and even into early adulthood. Unfortunately, some adults scarcely exhibit empathy at all, especially in pathological cases of criminality or exploitation. Our observations of people with little or no empathy prompt us—or at least should prompt us—to examine our own judgments and our self-confidence, to ensure that we respect the rights of others to hold opinions of their own. This applies to all manner of issues—life choices, political values, gender options, consumerism, career moves, educational opportunities, and much more. And it certainly figures into the world of ideas, ideologies, and beliefs. A wide range of options exists in each of these areas, choices that we all make personally and with stimulation from the thoughts and actions of others, not the least through close and meaningful association with select others",

Beliefs are subject to the vagaries and complexities of life, many out of our control. We may be born into a loving and supportive family or one that is abusive and violent. We may enjoy plenty or suffer hunger and want. We may benefit from good health and strength or experience disability and physical limitations. We may be free from disaster or be struck by a devastating, life-changing accident. We may be raised a Hindu, Buddhist, Muslim, Christian, or any of thousands of other religious variations. In all such cases we are not creators of our circumstances, whether they be good or bad. As much as we may wish to think of ourselves as the determiners of our fate, much lies outside our control. Of course, we are responsible for how we react to our given state of affairs, including the notions or ideas we hold about life and the world. Here is where belief, doubt, disbelief, and non-belief come into play. They all can coexist as viable responses to human existence and conditions.

The general comments made here need to be anchored in specifics, and I will do so with some autobiographical reflections about my own personal experiences and the evolution of my thinking about this topic, especially in light of the role and nature of religious thought. I was born in 1943 into a supportive family that sought to give my three siblings and me many opportunities and encouragement to be productive and happy in life. I should say, though, that our parents’ horizons were confined to quite traditional Christian options. While both of them had a university education and our father even earned a doctoral degree, they encouraged us to attend Christian colleges, which we all did except for our youngest brother. Our father was a minister in the American Baptist Convention, a denomination that is not as conservative and dogmatic as the larger Southern Baptist Convention. The latter had formed in 1845 because of its support of slavery, which the Baptists in the northern U.S. firmly opposed. The Southern Baptists also subscribe now to such principles as the inerrancy of the Bible, the belief in personal salvation in order to enter heaven and avoid eternity in hell, and such social positions as forbidding women to become clergy and condemning same-sex relationships",

All four of us siblings followed our parents in some of these more liberal social principles, but we all started to break away from their strictnessduring our university years, if not even before. In general, they instilled in all four of us siblings a set of values: a deep concern for the wellbeing of others; a sense of equality among races, genders, and peoples; a drive for knowledge instead of material acquisitions; a commitment to family and friends; an appreciation for music, art, and literature; an intrigue with cultural differences around the world; a love of travel; and a healthy work ethic. These are not beliefs as such, but more on the order of coordinates, points for orientation and action. None of us, though, carried forward our parents’ religiosity. Read the whole article here.

Each semester, the Divinity School will invite a member of the clergy, a nonprofit leader or a social justice activist to be “in residence” with its community. The PIR host sessions about their work, mentor students and invite them to visit their organization or congregation. Students will be exposed to experts who model the interdisciplinary, interfaith and justice work that is at the core of the Vanderbilt Divinity School community. “When I first started teaching, most of my students were headed into congregational ministry,” Dean Yolanda Pierce said. “Today, students are finding many more pathways to live out their vocational calling. The practitioner-in-residence program will help students better discern the many doors their VDS degree can open while strengthening relationships with community partners.” VDS is excited that Rev. Lindsey Krinks, MTS ’13, has agreed to serve as the inaugural practitioner-in-residence. Krinks is a street chaplain, activist, nonprofit leader and cofounder of Open Table Nashville , a nationally acclaimed interfaith homeless outreach nonprofit",

Krinks is a street chaplain, activist, nonprofit leader and cofounder of Open Table Nashville , a nationally acclaimed interfaith homeless outreach nonprofit. For more than 15 years, Krinks has worked on the less visible side of Nashville—the streets, encampments, jails, slums and underpasses—while also collaborating with faith leaders, community organizers and public officials to make the city more hospitable and just. She appeared in Saint Cloud Hill , a documentary about Nashville’s largest homeless camp in 2019, and has been featured in dozens of Nashville news stories. Her book, Praying with Our Feet: Pursuing Justice & Healing on the Streets , is widely available. “I was honored to be approached about this role and am excited to return to VDS,” Krinks said. Speaking about her time at Vanderbilt, she noted, “There was this rich, transformative experience at the Divinity School in which our work on the ground was informing our theological education and our classes were informing our social justice work.” The practitioner-in-residence program will kick off with a competition among Divinity School faculty, staff and students through the month of January to see who can collect the most items for Open Table Nashville’s winter supply list. The nonprofit delivers blankets, sleeping bags, hand warmers, thermal socks and protein shakes to Nashville’s most vulnerable population",

Conversation  partners will include Krinks, community activists, local government officials and multiple Vanderbilt professors whose research centers on homelessness. The semester’s events will wrap up on Thursday, April 17, when Krinks hosts “Downtown Urban Immersion: Learning to See the City from Below,” where she walks with students through homeless encampments, visits with their residents and talks more about her work.

Intersex people are born with differences in sex traits or reproductive anatomy. The phenomenon is as common as having red hair or green eyes, affecting almost 2 percent of the population. Lin Morales, a junior in the College of Arts and Science and co-president of the Vanderbilt Lambda Association, helped organize what he hopes will become an annual event. He was inspired by a course he took called Intersex in Christian Traditions: Perspectives from Science, Law, Culture and Theology, taught by the Divinity School’s Stephanie Budwey . “Our class had amazing discussions that increased my understanding about the challenges for intersex people,” said Morales, who is majoring in political science and studio art with a minor in religious studies. “I’m trans myself and found many connections between trans and intersex and other gender identities",

All of us are  impacted negatively by policies and laws that do not affirm our identities.” Speakers at the event included Morales, who gave introductory remarks; Ari Nevin, a senior who discussed law and policy; Dee Norman, a junior who spoke on sex and gender; and Budwey, assistant professor of the history and practice of Christian worship and the arts, whose topic was faith and theology. There were also three speakers from interACT, a national advocacy organization for intersex youth: Bria Brown-King, Maddie Moran and Marissa Adams. Jeremy Brooks McKinnon led a reflection following the screening of the narrative short film As Common as Red Hair and the new documentary Every Body . Brooks McKinnon  is a master of divinity candidate who is completing his final semester. Morales emphasized that the speaker series has set a precedent for intersex advocacy in the future, with plans underway to hold another campus event next year. He had reached out to Budwey last spring about bringing together people and resources from across campus to increase awareness and knowledge on intersex issues. “Lin was moved and energized to begin planning for an event in October,” said Budwey, author of Religion and Intersex: Perspectives from Science, Law, Culture and Theology . “The reality is that many folks do not know what intersex is or have a grave misunderstanding about the definition",

Rather than embracing that diversity, individuals are forced to feel very shameful about their bodies.” Budwey noted that infants and young children around the world have undergone medically unnecessary surgeries to try to fit them into certain understandings about sex and gender, and there can be severe repercussions. The Intersex Awareness Speaker Series is co-sponsored by the Carpenter Program in Religion, Gender and Sexuality and its Queer Faith, Policy and Liberation Cohort; Vanderbilt Lambda Association; LGTBQ+ Policy Lab; K.C. Potter Center for LGTBQI Life; and Religion in the Arts and Contemporary Culture program. “We hope to create more welcoming spaces, awareness and knowledge about gender and sexual identities, and to highlight those in order to bring greater inclusion and belonging to our world,” said Rachel Heath, assistant director of the Carpenter program.

Carter Ellis, MDiv, ’13, was selected as a delegate to the UMC General Conference, which took place April 3 – May 3 in Charlotte, North Carolina. “The goal for us who support LGBTQIA+ inclusion was to get to ‘neutral,’ so to speak, with UMC policies,” Ellis said. “We succeeded in removing harmful language, and in one or two instances, add protections for queer clergy, but it is by no means yet an explicitly inclusive policy.” With the approved changes, United Methodist pastors can no longer be punished for performing weddings of same-sex couples. Queer clergy are able to go through the ordination process while being open about their sexual orientation or gender identity. Those ministers who had their credentials removed for being queer can apply to have them reinstated. Ellis, who was skeptical about the church when she enrolled at the Divinity School, is grateful for witness from Divinity School faculty and staff who normalized what being queer and called to love and serve looks like. “We don’t see that witness very often in the church,” Ellis said",

She was ordained as an elder in 2017. Three years later she moved to Kansas City and took the courageous step of marriage with Lora Andrews, MDiv’14. “We were immediately placed under complaint through the denomination, which could have been processed toward losing our credentials,” Ellis said. “Our bishops held us in what’s called ‘abeyance’ while we waited and prayed for changes in the Book of Discipline. If the delegates at the General Conference had not voted the way they did, we could have faced a trial to decide if we could continue being clergy. Our careers have been defined by this work for justice.” Andrews, an ordained elder in the Great Plains (Kansas and Nebraska) Conference, attended this spring’s UMC General Conference as a member of its Queer Clergy Caucus and as a chaplain. She has advocated for removing discriminatory language targeting LGBTQIA+ clergy from UMC policies since her student days. Religion and Social Movements, a course taught by C. Melissa Snarr , the E. Rhodes and Leona B. Carpenter Professor of Ethics and Society, helped shape the focus of Andrews’work",

A decade later, I continue to apply what I learned in school to my ministry.” Also attending the conference was Eric Burton-Krieger, MDiv’11, who is transitioning his ministry from Indianapolis to Atlanta, Georgia. In 2007, he was selected for the first class of the Cal Turner Leadership Scholars program, which supported master of divinity candidates pursuing UMC ministry. Burton-Krieger enrolled at Vanderbilt because he wanted an academically rigorous education. However, being part of a deeply supportive community was an additional benefit. “Organizing for justice is hard work, and it’s taken decades in our denomination.

Burton-Krieger noted the influence of alumni/ae serving at Nashville area churches like Edgehill United Methodist and East End United Methodist. “They would share their Vanderbilt experiences with us students, but also talk about the impact of activism in their daily lives post-graduation,” he said. Brandon Baxter, MDiv’17, senior pastor at East End United Methodist Church, credits his Divinity School education for helping navigate power dynamics and relationships within the denomination.

Baxter previously served at West End United Methodist Church, where he helped  create more public visibility around his congregation’s affirmation for LGBTQIA+ people, especially after the 2019 General Conference. “I felt it was important—with the congregation’s proximity to Vanderbilt and location on a main city corridor—to be clear about our affirming and welcoming community,” Baxter said. “In addition, our lay leadership expanded our wedding policy, making it fully affirming for same-sex couples. I was proud of the congregation for taking these major steps in its journey of faith.” Even though these Vanderbilt Divinity alumni/ae were successful in helping to remove discriminatory language toward LGBTQIA+ people from the Book of Discipline, their work has only begun",

Melissa Snarr , program director and associate professor of ethics and society. Vanderbilt’s doctor of ministry in integrative chaplaincy is a six-semester hybrid program with a deep commitment to equip VA and military chaplains, as well as other institutional chaplains, with evidence-based practices of care. “Military and institutional chaplains are needed more than ever on the front lines of mental health care,” said Snarr, who also holds the E.

Since military chaplains are required to keep their conversations 100 percent confidential, those on active duty often turn to them first in a crisis.” Snarr noted that the Navy annually funds seven to eight spaces in the competitive program, while the VA sponsors 15 chaplains. She and Keith G. Meador , director of Integrative Mental Health with the VA and professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, began conversations several years ago on how best to extend and transform the VA certificate program into a full-fledged doctoral program. “We are committed to the formation of chaplains across the theological spectrum,” said Meador, who also holds the Anne Geddes Stahlman Chair in Medical Ethics. “The doctor of ministry program trains them in evidence-based practices to use within pluralistic contexts, while honoring their own diverse theological commitments as they meet the emotional and mental health needs of those who suffer.” The first three semesters, which are led by Meador and his VA team, focus on empirically proven practices for integrating spiritual and mental health care into chaplaincy",

Three nearly weeklong “intensives” happen on the Vanderbilt campus, with all other meetings for the degree taking place virtually. Among the current students is Lt. Chris Terrell, an active-duty Navy chaplain from Pensacola, Florida, who enrolled in the doctor of ministry program in 2020. He was recently redeployed with the USS Leyte Gulf , a guided missile cruiser, and is grateful to be able to work on his research project while being deployed. “To write for my research is a wonderful blessing, helping me decompress from any stresses I have during my limited free time on the ship,” Terrell said. “As a military chaplain, I often counsel people on a variety of bad experiences, serving more than 300 people on this vessel.” He is developing a small-group model for what he calls “deconstructing unhelpful Christian theology and at the same time helping those persons reconstruct a more authentic Christian identity.” Terrell is using the tools that come out of acceptance and commitment therapy to help create that small-group space. “The doctor of ministry program has given me skills that enable me to do more than listen and pray.

Laura Palmer, a Navy chaplain who is based in North Carolina. She has begun her fourth semester in the doctoral program. “Learning alongside chaplains from various settings has fostered insightful conversations and afforded opportunities to further explore and give voice to the ‘whys and hows’ of the care we can provide,” Palmer said. “The focus on collaboration with mental health practitioners—learning their language and utilizing different modalities—dovetails into building spiritual readiness. That is the strength of spirit that enables the warfighter to accomplish the mission with honor. And the opportunity to engage with chaplains from the VA and other contexts has reaffirmed for me the care that is extended through the seasons of a service member’s life.” For her doctor of ministry project, she wants to explore how spirituality and its neural effects might serve as a protective factor and offer steps toward hope and healing in response to the neurobiological overlaps found in shame and suicidality. The Divinity School currently enrolls more active military and veterans than all the other nine schools of the university combined, with 19 of the 26 2023 graduating doctor of ministry students (the first graduating class) being military members and veterans",

His dedication to justice began early in his career, when he was licensed to the ministry in 1988 and ordained in 1990, serving local parishes such as Zion United Church of Christ in Henderson, Kentucky, where he transformed a small congregation into a vibrant, multiracial, open and affirming community of over 300 members. From 1992–2000, Dr. Guess was among the earliest openly gay clergy in the UCC’s Indiana-Kentucky Conference. His pastoral work continued in Kentucky in 1994, where he led one of the state’s first openly affirming congregations. Dr. Guess has also been deeply involved in various justice initiatives, co-founding the Kentucky Fairness Campaign, the state’s leading LGBTQ advocacy organization. He broadened his efforts to health services, leading the initiative to open an on-site Planned Parenthood clinic at his church and co-founded Matthew 25 AIDS Services, one of the largest nonprofit health service providers for individuals with HIV in Kentucky. Over the past 36 years, Dr. Guess has built an impressive career in ordained ministry and organizational leadership within the UCC and nonprofit sectors. Dr. Guess established monumental precedent as the first openly LGBTQ+ individual elected to serve as a national officer and executive minister of the denomination",

He continued making history from 2011–2016 as the first openly LGBTQ+ person elected to its national Collegium of Officers, exemplifying courage and furthering progress within faith-based leadership. Throughout his career, Dr. Guess has authored numerous articles and op-eds and has been an advocate for racial, social, gender and economic justice. Dr. Guess has also served on numerous boards, including the National LGBTQ Task Force, National Jobs With Justice, the Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland and many more. Beyond his ministry work, Dr. Guess has served in multiple capacities as a national director within the UCC, including as director of communications, identity and publications and editor of United Church News, where Dr. Guess advocated and editorialized for the importance of an independent church press, free from editorial oversight of denominational executives. During his tenure, he played an instrumental role in advancing media justice and religious freedom, culminating in his role as lead spokesperson for UCC v. Cooper , the historic case which brought marriage equality to North Carolina in 2014, and eventually the entire U.S. Fourth Circuit. In June 2017, Dr. Guess became the executive director of the ACLU of Ohio, where he currently leads a team with offices in Columbus, Cleveland and Cincinnati",

Under his leadership, the organization advances political participation, voting rights, criminal legal system reform, personal autonomy, dignity and greater inclusion and belonging for all Ohioans. Most recently, he played a leading role in Ohio’s November 2023 ballot campaign, which successfully safeguarded abortion rights and reproductive freedom. Currently, he is integral to Ohio’s campaign to end gerrymandering through the creation of a new citizen-led Independent Redistricting Commission. Reflecting on his impactful career, Dr. Guess’ academic rigor, theological insight and passion for social justice have profoundly shaped his vocation. His legacy is an ongoing testament to Vanderbilt Divinity School’s mission of fostering transformative leaders who live out their values in service to justice and equity. His work continues to inspire future faith leaders and advocates committed to making lasting change. Williamson has dedicated his life to justice, ethics and advocacy through ministry and scholarship. Dr. Williamson’s early commitment to social justice can be traced back to his undergraduate years, where he was among the students from Wake Forest and Winston-Salem State University who took part in the historic Greensboro and Winston-Salem lunch counter sit-ins of 1960",

These momentous sit-ins launched a critical student leadership movement, with the sit-ins sweeping across the nation as students protested segregated lunch counters and other public spaces, with many white students joining the effort. The sit-ins Dr. Williamson took part in also included several arrests, and attracted widespread media attention to the issue of segregation. On February 23, 1960, a Winston-Salem sit-in marked a milestone as the first to include white participants—among them, ten students from Wake Forest, including Dr. Williamson. With twenty individuals, both black and white, standing together, this gathering became the first sit-in to result in arrests, including Dr. Williamson, establishing a powerful precedent just days before the Nashville sit-ins led by Rev. James Lawson. The sit-in ultimately led to the desegregation of the city’s restaurants and lunch counters just three months later, making it the first successful sit-in protest in North Carolina. As a doctoral candidate, Dr. Williamson was appointed chaplain and associate professor of religion at Vassar College, where he served and taught for over a decade, instilling in students a commitment to social justice and ethical leadership until 1981. He was also a member of the Science, Technology and Society Program and the American Culture multi-disciplinary programs at Vassar, where his leadership ultimately led them to divest from South Africa.

Dr. Williamson then returned to pastoral work, where he was called to serve as pastor of First Baptist Church of Granville, Ohio, now known as The United Church of Granville. During his tenure, he led FBC Granville to be Welcoming and Affirming and presented and advocated for LGBTQ issues before the denomination. At the time, FBC Granville was the only place for gay weddings and ordinations in the area. Under Dr. Williamson’s leadership, the church also became headquarters for Habitat for Humanity and an AIDS Task Force. Additionally, FBC Granville was part of the Sanctuary Movement, a political and religious campaign that emerged in the early 1980s, dedicated to offering safe haven for Central American refugees. These efforts were not without challenge, as they faced fierce opposition from those opposed to LGBTQ rights and sanctuary practices. The church’s Feminist Sunday School class played a pivotal role in the organization Women Have Options , providing essential support to women who faced barriers to accessing abortion services. In the mid-1980s, the church also contributed to the historic Gang Summit , a groundbreaking peace gathering in St. Louis that brought together gang leaders from across the country in the pursuit of nonviolent solutions",

In 1984, Dr. Williamson, with other peacemakers, founded the Baptist Peace Fellowship of North America, an organization devoted to peace and reconciliation, where he served as the founding president. Dr. Williamson played a key role in organizing and leading the founding meeting of the BPFNA. Notably, Dr. Williamson represented BPFNA, now known as BPFNA ~ Bautistas por la Paz , on a peace mission to Iraq one month before the first Iraq War. During the Contra War, FBC Granville, in collaboration with the BPFNA, purchased a school bus, stocked it with essential food and medicine, and sent it to Nicaragua. Two families from the congregation undertook the journey, delivering aid to support the work of Gustavo Parajon, a former student pastor who was engaged in critical medical and agricultural work in the Nicaraguan jungles.
