Research integrity is crucial for exceptional research and is seen as a vital part of training, regardless of funding source.The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) require that all those engaged in either NIH- or NSF-funded research must also be educated in the Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR). Vanderbilt has developed programs to meet these requirements and to ensure that its students, faculty, and staff, as appropriate, understand the issues surrounding the RCR, and their obligations as individuals and members of the larger research community.\u202fVanderbilt\u2019s approach to RCR training incorporates online and discussion-based content based on the individual\u2019s experience level and discipline. The RCR series covers core norms, principles, regulations, and rules governing the practice of research. All graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in certain departments are expected to complete training in responsible conduct of research (RCR). In addition, depending upon the program in which the student or trainee is enrolled, they may have additional RCR requirements for ongoing training.

These programs, whether campus-wide like the Vanderbilt Summer Research Program (VUSRP) or department-specific like the Physics Department\u2019s Research Experience for Undergraduates (PA-REU) have four primary goals: To provide a substantive research experience that will allow each student to actively participate in a research project including reading the relevant literature, developing ideas, and communicating findings to colleagues. To provide enrichment seminars that will help construct a strong foundation on which to build science, social science, and humanistic careers. To create opportunities for student-faculty interaction beyond the classroom and facilitate mentor relationships for students who wish to pursue research and academic careers",

Our History Since its founding in 1873, Vanderbilt University has offered coursework beyond the baccalaureate degree and developed focused programs in several professional areas.\u00a0 The university granted its first Master of Arts (in Greek, Latin and English) and Doctor of Philosophy (in Chemistry) degrees in 1879. In 1935, by action of the Board of Trust, Vanderbilt established a separate Graduate School to expand its offerings and begin conferring degrees in partnership with professional schools and colleges throughout the university. As part of this process, an official faculty was assembled by selecting subject matter experts from various schools across the university. Today, the Vanderbilt Graduate School faculty is made up of the university\u2019s top researchers and educators who are deeply committed to the development of future scholars. 8,718 Doctor of Philosophy Degrees awarded 9,581 Master's Degrees awarded Doctor of Philosophy Degrees awarded Master's Degrees awarded Our Leadership Our team of knowledgeable and diverse faculty and staff is dedicated to fostering the uniquely supportive and collaborative environment for which Vanderbilt is known.

Transcript Submission How to Submit Upload electronic copies of your unofficial transcripts via the online application. If you are having trouble uploading your transcript, the following tips may help: Make sure your file is in PDF format and does not exceed 1.5 MB (1,500 kb) in size. Once you have uploaded your file, click the \"Preview Upload\" button to ensure that these document you uploaded is legible throughout. If your document is not legible, the processing of your application will be delayed. The system will not allow you to submit your online application unless you upload a document for every school listed in the Academic History\u00a0section. If you have followed the above guidelines and still cannot upload your transcript, upload a statement instead explaining why you cannot upload the transcript. You will then submit a PDF copy of each transcript individually to graduateschooladmissions@vanderbilt.edu. Do not e-mail your transcripts unless you have exhausted all options for uploading the transcripts to the academic History section of the application.

Attended multiple undergraduate institutions. Self Calculation Instructions To self-calculate your GPA, please utilize the GPA Calculator from Scholaro Reports to create a line-by-line assessment of your UGPA. About UGPA Calculations: It is not necessary to pay for a credential evaluation when using the Scholaro Reports GPA Calculator. The UGPA should include all undergraduate course work completed at the time of submission of the application. If you attended more than one school, you must include the grades from all undergraduate schools in calculating your UGPA. If your schools are in different countries, please run the Scholaro Reports GPA Calculator for each school. To arrive at a cumulative GPA, use the example below: School 1:\u00a0 20 credits x 3.9 GPA = 78 School 2: 123 credits x 3.5 GPA = 431 (rounded) Cumulative GPA = (78+431)/(20+123) = 509/143 = 3.6 (rounded) Do not include courses that were dropped or courses that did not award letter grades (e.g. satisfactory/unsatisfactory, pass/fail, credit only).

Are three-year degrees recognized by Vanderbilt? The decisions about equivalency of degrees as appropriate for admission to Graduate School are made on a case-by-case basis. The main input into this decision is that of the department/program. If a student with a certain degree has the qualifications that a department considers appropriate for admission, then the department can make the case to the Graduate School. The Graduate School cannot make a blanket statement regarding types of programs that are acceptable because many may not be. We advise you to continue with your application, but it would be wise to contact your department of interest directly to discuss the relevant issues. You can find a list of Graduate School programs here: https://gradschool.vanderbilt.edu/academics/department-contacts/ What happens if I do not respond to my offer of admission? If you are admitted into a program and do not communicate your decision with the program in a timely manner, your offer will be rescinded.

Please contact your program of interest directly for feedback.

In 2021, Christie-Mizell launched an enhanced funding and support model for doctoral education, supported by Provost and Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs C. Cybele Raver\u2019s new $5 million annual investment in graduate education. The new model is the outcome of a yearlong project to collect and review data from constituents across the university. \u201cOur graduate faculty partners shared with us that they needed a solution to providing enhanced support for doctoral students,\u201d Christie-Mizell said. \u201cThrough the creation of five funding supplements, we have created more financial support across all schools and programs for graduate student discovery, research and creative endeavors.\u201d Christie-Mizell has made it a priority to recruit, train, and place a diverse group of scholars",

As a first-generation student who grew up in the rural South, and as a leader in graduate education at Vanderbilt with multiple minority statuses, he shares his own experiences that inspire him to pave the way for the next generation of diverse faculty and academic leaders in the academy. From his own research on racial group identity, stratification, and inequality, to his leadership in the Graduate School expanding initiatives and programs to build a diverse pipeline of future academics, his steadfast commitment to equity, diversity, and inclusion is embedded in the way he teaches, mentors, and leads. His efforts were essential in the establishment of the Vanderbilt-Fisk Joint Postdoctoral Fellowship Program\u2014a program that fosters collaboration between Vanderbilt and Fisk\u2019s campuses to prepare doctor students for the professoriate. \u201cThese fellowships will expand our partnership into the postdoctoral space, creating another pathway to careers in academia,\u201d said Christie-Mizell. Since joining Vanderbilt\u2019s Sociology department as a tenured professor in 2010, Christie-Mizell has received the 2021 Leadership Award from the Chancellor\u2019s Office and a 2015 Distinguished Faculty Award for his exceptional work as a graduate student mentor",
