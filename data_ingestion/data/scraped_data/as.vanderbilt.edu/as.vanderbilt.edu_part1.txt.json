Humanity needs the study of anthropology now more than ever. We live in a world that is at once hyperconnected and fragmented. Anthropology\u2014the study of humanity in all times and places\u2014uniquely enables us to understand the full breadth of human diversity while appreciating our common connections. While other disciplines partition the human whole for insights, anthropology seeks to understand how all dimensions of humanity\u2014everything from our biological constituents to our social, political, religious, and economic practices and institutions\u2014are deeply interconnected. Rather than isolating variables, anthropologists seek to understand connections. Reflecting our disciplinary breadth, anthropology students go on to make vital contributions in the private, public, and nonprofit sectors, with rewarding careers in everything from law, medicine and public health, consulting, and business. We invite you to take up the challenge and promise of anthropology to find novel perspectives and solutions to the issues facing our changing world. major ph.d. research Spotlight   \n================================================================================\n\nScraped from: https://as.vanderbilt.edu/historyart/\nDate scraped: 2025-02-17 02:45:08",

Advising at A&S takes place in two stages: pre-major and major advising. All A&S students\u00a0are assigned a CASPAR (pre-major) adviser, whom they work with until they declare a major. Your CASPAR adviser will contact you during the summer prior to your first year and will work with you until you declare your major sometime in your second year at Vanderbilt. They will help you pinpoint your academic interests and career goals, choose an appropriate major to fit them, and choose and register for classes. Visit the CASPAR website Once you declare a major, you will be assigned an adviser in the appropriate academic department . Your major adviser, together with your major department\u2019s Director of Undergraduate Studies, will help you choose courses that suit your interests and career goals, assist you in staying on track to graduate, and help you identify opportunities (such as internships, study abroad, and research) that will enrich your classroom studies and prepare you for your chosen career.

        "text": "Pre-Architecture Advising Pre-architecture advising at Vanderbilt focuses on supporting each advisee in building a personalized plan to prepare for graduate study and careers in architecture or related design fields. Graduate programs in Architecture and related disciplines (including Landscape Architecture, Environmental Design, Urban Planning, Historic Preservation, Graphic Design, and Product Design) place high value on self-driven and curious applicants who have engaged dynamically with their undergraduate studies. Vanderbilt\u2019s unique emphasis on individual, experimental learning, cultural enrichment, and immersion lends itself exceptionally well to fostering the types of industrious, free-thinking creators who are prized by the best graduate architecture programs and who become trail-blazers in the architecture profession. Choice of Major Pre-architecture advisees may major in any discipline. Degrees in economics, biology, classics, engineering, philosophy, environmental science, computer science, and other fields are respected and thoroughly applicable starting points for graduate study in architecture. Many students have found that a major or minor in Studio Art or History of Art and Architecture are especially valuable in supporting the portfolio-building process and course prerequisites",

Many students have found that a major or minor in Studio Art or History of Art and Architecture are especially valuable in supporting the portfolio-building process and course prerequisites. Particularly applicable to pre-architecture study is Vanderbilt\u2019s Architecture and the Built Environment (ABE) major and minor, which allow for exceptional flexibility in the interdisciplinary study of spatial questions. While based in the Department of History of Art and Architecture, students can accrue 50% of their credit toward the major by choosing from hundreds of classes in dozens of departments around the university. More information on the ABE major and minor can be found here . Coursework Both Vanderbilt and the directors of many architecture graduate programs encourage pre-architecture students to explore intellectual and technical questions from perspectives outside the profession so that they will be able to apply their interdisciplinary experience to the specialized questions that they will encounter in graduate school and beyond. Experience in critical thinking, visual representation, writing, and creative problem solving will strengthen an application. These can be achieved in the process of fulfilling the core requirements within each student\u2019s respective college (AXLE in Arts and Sciences, Liberal Education Core in Peabody, Core Curriculum in Engineering)",

In selecting core courses, pre-architecture students should attend to their particular interests and needs, making sure both to build on strengths and to fill gaps in skill and knowledge. Students should also seek out courses that allow for investigative projects that can be appropriated to their portfolios (see below ). Prerequisites Different Master of Architecture (MArch) programs uphold different prerequisites, but nearly all maintain the same spirit and general categories, requiring 1) one or two courses in mathematics and the sciences, and 2) one or two courses in history of architecture. In mathematics and the sciences, schools commonly require a course in calculus, in physics, or both. Some schools are less specific in these STEM requirements; some are more particular. In history of architecture, some schools require one or two courses of any topic within the discipline; other schools require one or two surveys that focus specifically on modern or pre-modern architecture. Prior to your senior year, research the schools that interest you and identify their specific requirements",

While most programs permit students to complete some outstanding requirements as late as the summer before the MArch program begins, the strongest applications will have completed rigorous versions of the required courses (e.g., physics for engineering majors rather than physics for non-science majors) at the time of application. These prerequisite courses serve the applicant in two ways: they demonstrate a competence across the multiple skill-sets required of architects, and they provide the foundations for the advanced and more narrowly-focused coursework that will be undertaken in the MArch program. Note that a few schools also explicitly require one or two courses in the humanities; these are typically of the kind that any Vanderbilt student will have taken as part of their core requirements. A few schools also require a studio-arts course in graphic representation or architectural design; most students will have taken such a course in the process of developing a portfolio.

MArch Application: Personal Statement Whereas application essays for undergraduate study tend to focus on the general character of the applicant, the strongest architecture school application essays articulate the applicant\u2019s relationship with architecture. In what direction might you eventually take your architecture practice? Why? What excites you about today\u2019s architecture? How would you design differently? Have you had an experience that prompts your particular interests in the field? Are you motivated by a specific conviction\u2014social, political, personal, philosophical\u2014that you expect to drive your architecture practice? Do you have a particular skill or fascination that you expect to use as an architect\u2014maybe facility with complex geometries, or interpersonal abilities, or graphic representation? These are some of the questions you might explore in your statement. Do not use your essay to list your qualifications or your extracurriculars. Also, avoid stories about playing with blocks or legos as a child; the topic is hackneyed. Most students build one essay and adapt it to the particulars of the various schools to which they are applying",

Most students build one essay and adapt it to the particulars of the various schools to which they are applying. The best personal statements do this attentively: rather than simply leaving space at the end of the essay in order to mention the names of a few famous professors at that school, articulate instead why, really, you would like to study at this particular school, integrating this with the substance of your essay wherever possible. This requires getting to know each program well and can improve not only your personal statement but also your own process of selecting a school and your understanding of the profession. Most importantly, give yourself a buffer in writing your essay, both temporal and psychological. Begin writing months before applications are due. Have others read your essay early and often, and discuss it with people you trust and who know you\u2014including, but not only, your pre-architecture advisor. Most applicants start writing their essays as an effort to fool a school into accepting them. Surprisingly often, a rigorous, well-paced writing process leads to genuine reflection on career, education, and fulfillment, and the resulting essay is self-evidently honest and considerably more compelling than the initial effort",

MArch Application:\u00a0Letters of Recommendation Most MArch applications require one or two letters of recommendation.\u00a0 Request these early\u2014at least a month before your application is due. Choose recommenders who know you and who can speak specifically to your abilities in and potential for the study and practice of architecture. This means building relationships throughout your time in college, finding mentors, supervisors, professors, etc., who will remember you and have seen your best work. Keep in mind that writing a letter of recommendation is a substantial task for the recommender, often taking hours of effort and days of reflection. Out of respect for the professor\u2019s time and in order to receive a strong letter, you should make the process as easy for the recommender as possible. Ask politely and early, and be sure to make your request in a flexible way. You might ask, \u201cWould you feel comfortable writing a letter recommending me for\u2026?\u201d\u00a0 This allows the potential recommender a judicious way out if, for whatever reason, she expects that her letter would not be beneficial to you.

MArch Application:\u00a0GREs and Transcripts Standardized tests and grades matter when applying to MArch programs, but rarely as much as Vanderbilt students expect. This is not undergraduate admissions: most MArch admissions committees use this data to confirm that a student is capable, responsible, and diligent. Few if any insist on the highest numbers from everyone it admits. Therefore: keep your grades strong and study for the GRE, but don\u2019t despair over a low score, and do not give up on a school you are interested in because of imperfect numbers. If your record has outstanding inconsistencies for some particular reason\u2014such as a weak semester because of a personal loss or illness\u2014consider asking a mentor or administrator to include a note with your application that explains the inconsistency.

Every major MArch program requires a portfolio as part of its application process, and most allot the highest importance to this portion of the application. The portfolio itself is a major design project. Students should allot, at minimum, a full semester to design and repeatedly, thoroughly revise their portfolios. Preferably, a portfolio is a multi-year project, with the pre-architecture student designing a working portfolio in freshman or sophomore year, then continuously adding projects to the portfolio while also periodically revising or fully redesigning the portfolio itself across subsequent semesters.\u00a0 A portfolio is not simply a series of images of one\u2019s work. To the contrary, its design, sequencing, grouping, omissions, and textual explanations should serve to articulate an image of oneself as a designer. This concept may seem abstract, even na\u00efve, to the uninitiated, but, as with most tasks in professional architecture, the laborious process of creating a portfolio gives its creator new eyes to see and understand both one\u2019s own and others\u2019 designs.

Portfolio: logistics, conventions, character Most MArch programs require that the portfolio be submitted as a single pdf file about 30 pages long. It is best created using a desktop publishing application such as Adobe inDesign. A good place to begin thinking about portfolios is to page through a variety of examples, collections of which are linked below. Keep in mind that most of the below examples are the result of years of work by experienced designers.
