Overview A judicial clerkship is one of the most prestigious and valuable experiences available to a recent law graduate. Judicial clerks gain inside knowledge of how parties pursue actual cases and how judges resolve legal issues. They receive exposure to substantive law and procedure while developing their research and writing skills. They also have the opportunity to build a mentoring relationship with an experienced judge and a professional network with fellow and former clerks that will extend well into their legal careers. Clerkships are available at all levels of the federal and state court systems, as well as with more specialized courts such as bankruptcy and tax courts. The process for obtaining a clerkship is extremely competitive, but Vanderbilt Law provides expert support throughout, boasting exceptional outcomes year over year.

The center serves survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault, and Burgess saw firsthand how attorneys helped clients understand their rights and what to expect in court. \u201cMy role was to listen, offer compassion, and acknowledge the difficult experiences our clients had gone through. While I recognize the importance of this role, witnessing lawyers assist clients more concretely made me realize I wanted to help people in ways only a law degree would allow me to do,\u201d she said. A native of Kingsport, Tennessee, Emily graduated from Peabody, where she studied human and organizational development, philosophy, and economics and history. After her experience at the Jean Crow Advocacy Center led her to apply to law schools, Vanderbilt\u2019s collegial culture cemented her choice. She also received two scholarships earmarked for students seeking careers in public interest law: the Judge Martha Craig Daughtrey Scholarship and the Justice-Moore Family Scholarship",

She also received two scholarships earmarked for students seeking careers in public interest law: the Judge Martha Craig Daughtrey Scholarship and the Justice-Moore Family Scholarship. At Vanderbilt, Emily has prepared for a career in civil legal service work by choosing from a broad array of social justice courses; she received the Scholastic Excellence Award in several classes, including Immigration Law and Policy, Actual Innocence Juvenile Justice, and Justice and Mass Incarceration. As a 2L, she worked as a research assistant for Professor Karla McKanders . When Memphis-based immigration attorney Andrew Rankin asked McKanders if a student might be interested in researching and writing an article for the Tennessee Bar Association\u2019s immigration law newsletter, McKanders encouraged Emily to take the assignment. Her article, \u201cGarcia de Leon v. Garland: A Foot in the Door for Administrative Closure in the Sixth Circuit,\u201d was published in 2021. Her work with Rankin on the article led to part-time work with his firm and whetted Emily\u2019s interest in immigration law. \u201cI had not really done academic legal writing before Professor McKanders suggested I write the TBA newsletter piece,\u201d she said. \u201cThat experience gave me confidence.\u201d Emily also participated in the Workers Advocacy Practicum taught by Assistant Dean and Martha Craig Daughtrey Director for Public Interest Spring Miller",

She wrote an opinion piece, \u201cThe High Stakes of Being a Low-Wage Tennessee Worker,\u201d which The Tennessean published on Jan. 18, 2022, based on a report practicum students published that details the dearth of legal resources for low-income workers in Tennessee. To produce the report, students analyzed national data and data collected by the Tennessee Alliance for Legal Services and interviewed with civil legal service attorneys across the state. \u201cThe report found that many workers don\u2019t realize that work-related problems like wrongful termination or difficulty securing unemployment benefits are legal issues. And even when they do, resources to help workers who can\u2019t pay for legal representation are limited and overburdened,\u201d she said. During summers 2020 and 2021, Emily worked as an intern with Pisgah Legal Services of Asheville, North Carolina, and with the Tennessee Office of the Post-Conviction Defender, where she faced some sobering realities about the limits of legal advocacy. \u201cMy experience with the Post-Conviction Defender\u2019s office redefined for me what constitutes a \u2018win\u2019 in this profession,\u201d she said",
