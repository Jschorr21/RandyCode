The Public Interest Office facilitates pro bono and service opportunities, including the Woodbine Immigration Clinic, the Shade Tree Medical-Legal Partnership and Court Watch programs. Many students also pursue summer and semester work in legal nonprofits, government agencies, prosecutors’ offices, or public defense offices. These students often receive course credit or summer stipends funded by the law school to help defray living expenses",

Career Services works with you to develop your resume and insure that your package includes all of the information required for the interview process, including transcripts. Students “bid” for interviews with specific firms or for specific positions. The interview schedule is calculated according to your bid rank and employer preference. Employers choose half of their schedules for first-year interviews and one-third of their schedules for the second and third years. If more students bid for interviews with a specific employer than slots are available, students are placed on a waiting list. Career Services develops and posts the interview schedule. Students have an opportunity to fill remaining interview slots or slots vacated due to cancellations. 4.

Vanderbilt's Clinical Legal Education Program offers students opportunities to represent clients under close supervision by members of the clinical faculty—and to explore the role of attorneys in shaping public policy. Students may choose from several practice areas, including civil, criminal, international, juvenile, domestic violence, business law, and community and economic development. By participating in clinics, students learn basic lawyering skills, such as interviewing, negotiation and case preparation. They also become familiar with the way the legal system works and the various participants in the legal system; and their professional responsibilities as attorneys. Vanderbilt's International Practice Lab allows students to complete two substantive legal research projects that support high-profile clients with pressing needs. Vanderbilt Law School's Externship Program provides opportunities for students to work under the supervision of faculty mentors and site supervisors in legal venues in Nashville and elsewhere in the U.S., at the International Criminal Tribunal at The Hague, and in other public sectors",

    "text": "Judicial Clerkship Program Vanderbilt Law School’s Judicial Clerkship Program provides support throughout the process and has enjoyed great success in securing clerkships at all levels of the judicial system. Overview A judicial clerkship is one of the most prestigious and valuable experiences available to a recent law graduate. Judicial clerks gain inside knowledge of how parties pursue actual cases and how judges resolve legal issues. They receive exposure to substantive law and procedure while developing their research and writing skills. They also have the opportunity to build a mentoring relationship with an experienced judge and a professional network with fellow and former clerks that will extend well into their legal careers. Clerkships are available at all levels of the federal and state court systems, as well as with more specialized courts such as bankruptcy and tax courts. The process for obtaining a clerkship is extremely competitive, but Vanderbilt Law provides expert support throughout, boasting exceptional outcomes year over year.

On Campus Opportunities The Vanderbilt Moot Court promotes the practice of effective appellate advocacy by leading all appellate advocacy activities at Vanderbilt Law School. Each year, the Board produces a unique Constitutional Law moot court problem and runs the Bass Berry & Sims Intramural Moot Court Competition, which serves as the selection process for new board members. The Moot Court Board also holds tryouts for students to compete in traveling teams that participate in various moot court competitions around the country. Finally, the Board assists the law school's Legal Writing Department in organizing and implementing the first-year oral arguments program, a required component of the Legal Writing curriculum. Students who compete in the mock trial competition in their second year are chosen to serve on the Mock Trial Board in their third year. Board members may also be chosen as members of one of two mock trial teams that will compete in a regional, and if successful, a national competition",

    "text": "Emily Burgess ’22 Feb 24, 2023, 1:48 PM Twitter Facebook Email LinkedIn Emily Burgess became interested in a career in public interest law while working as an intern with the Jean Crow Advocacy Center as an undergraduate at Vanderbilt’s Peabody College. The center serves survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault, and Burgess saw firsthand how attorneys helped clients understand their rights and what to expect in court. “My role was to listen, offer compassion, and acknowledge the difficult experiences our clients had gone through. While I recognize the importance of this role, witnessing lawyers assist clients more concretely made me realize I wanted to help people in ways only a law degree would allow me to do,” she said. A native of Kingsport, Tennessee, Emily graduated from Peabody, where she studied human and organizational development, philosophy, and economics and history. After her experience at the Jean Crow Advocacy Center led her to apply to law schools, Vanderbilt’s collegial culture cemented her choice. She also received two scholarships earmarked for students seeking careers in public interest law: the Judge Martha Craig Daughtrey Scholarship and the Justice-Moore Family Scholarship",

    "text": ". She also received two scholarships earmarked for students seeking careers in public interest law: the Judge Martha Craig Daughtrey Scholarship and the Justice-Moore Family Scholarship. At Vanderbilt, Emily has prepared for a career in civil legal service work by choosing from a broad array of social justice courses; she received the Scholastic Excellence Award in several classes, including Immigration Law and Policy, Actual Innocence Juvenile Justice, and Justice and Mass Incarceration. As a 2L, she worked as a research assistant for Professor Karla McKanders . When Memphis-based immigration attorney Andrew Rankin asked McKanders if a student might be interested in researching and writing an article for the Tennessee Bar Association’s immigration law newsletter, McKanders encouraged Emily to take the assignment. Her article, “Garcia de Leon v. Garland: A Foot in the Door for Administrative Closure in the Sixth Circuit,” was published in 2021. Her work with Rankin on the article led to part-time work with his firm and whetted Emily’s interest in immigration law. “I had not really done academic legal writing before Professor McKanders suggested I write the TBA newsletter piece,” she said. “That experience gave me confidence.” Emily also participated in the Workers Advocacy Practicum taught by Assistant Dean and Martha Craig Daughtrey Director for Public Interest Spring Miller",

    "text": ". “That experience gave me confidence.” Emily also participated in the Workers Advocacy Practicum taught by Assistant Dean and Martha Craig Daughtrey Director for Public Interest Spring Miller . She wrote an opinion piece, “The High Stakes of Being a Low-Wage Tennessee Worker,” which The Tennessean published on Jan. 18, 2022, based on a report practicum students published that details the dearth of legal resources for low-income workers in Tennessee. To produce the report, students analyzed national data and data collected by the Tennessee Alliance for Legal Services and interviewed with civil legal service attorneys across the state. “The report found that many workers don’t realize that work-related problems like wrongful termination or difficulty securing unemployment benefits are legal issues. And even when they do, resources to help workers who can’t pay for legal representation are limited and overburdened,” she said. During summers 2020 and 2021, Emily worked as an intern with Pisgah Legal Services of Asheville, North Carolina, and with the Tennessee Office of the Post-Conviction Defender, where she faced some sobering realities about the limits of legal advocacy. “My experience with the Post-Conviction Defender’s office redefined for me what constitutes a ‘win’ in this profession,” she said",
