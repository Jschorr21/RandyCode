Tennessee’s capital also is an international destination for the arts, entrepreneurship and scientific research, thereby attracting world-renowned scholars to Vanderbilt and the broader community. In turn, it’s no surprise that many students choose to call Music City home, even after their time as Vanderbilt students comes to an end. Major regional industries include music and entertainment, tourism, printing and publishing, technology, higher education, automobile production and health care management.

History Settled in 1779 along the banks of the Cumberland River, Nashville became Tennessee’s state capital in 1843. Just 30 years later, Vanderbilt University was founded—marking the start of an enduring relationship between a dynamic Southern city and a world-class research institution. Climate Nashville’s climate is often characterized as mild, with colder winter months and high temperatures in the summer. Most of the city’s rain occurs during the spring, and if a snowfall does occur, it’s seldom heavy. Campus life at Vanderbilt benefits tremendously from the city’s temperate weather, as outdoor activities can typically occur throughout the academic year. Transportation While several restaurants and cultural attractions are within easy walking distance of Vanderbilt’s campus, ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft also are widely available throughout Nashville. For getting into and out of the city, the award-winning Nashville International Airport provides nonstop flights to 75 markets, including Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, London, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C",

FutureVU embodies the university’s core values and holistic approach to Vanderbilt’s teaching, research and service mission, including the advancement of the university’s land resources and human capital in support of the Academic Strategic Plan. In 2015, FutureVU began as a comprehensive land use planning effort, with the goal of ensuring the Vanderbilt University campus is designed and prepared at every level to support its students, faculty and staff, and to uphold the university’s mission and values. While academic and student residential building projects on campus are driven by the Academic Strategic Plan, and the academic and research mission of the university, the FutureVU land use plan provides a consistent strategy and guiding principles necessary for the realization of all capital projects and changes to the built environment. More recently, FutureVU, the overarching campus planning process, was expanded to be a more holistic model, developing the spaces on campus and investing in the initiatives that support the people who live, work and learn in them. A Framework for the Future FutureVU provides a framework for the future of Vanderbilt, while considering core themes such as inclusion and accessibility, sustainability, transportation and mobility, connectivity and community enhancement, engagement with surrounding communities, and preservation of the historic park-like setting",
