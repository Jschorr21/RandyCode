History Settled in 1779 along the banks of the Cumberland River, Nashville became Tennessee\u2019s state capital in 1843. Just 30 years later, Vanderbilt University was founded\u2014marking the start of an enduring relationship between a dynamic Southern city and a world-class research institution. Climate Nashville\u2019s climate is often characterized as mild, with colder winter months and high temperatures in the summer. Most of the city\u2019s rain occurs during the spring, and if a snowfall does occur, it\u2019s seldom heavy. Campus life at Vanderbilt benefits tremendously from the city\u2019s temperate weather, as outdoor activities can typically occur throughout the academic year. Transportation While several restaurants and cultural attractions are within easy walking distance of Vanderbilt\u2019s campus, ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft also are widely available throughout Nashville. For getting into and out of the city, the award-winning Nashville International Airport provides nonstop flights to 75 markets, including Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, London, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C",

FutureVU embodies the university\u2019s core values and holistic approach to Vanderbilt\u2019s teaching, research and service mission, including the advancement of the university\u2019s land resources and human capital in support of the Academic Strategic Plan. In 2015, FutureVU began as a comprehensive land use planning effort, with the goal of ensuring the Vanderbilt University campus is designed and prepared at every level to support its students, faculty and staff, and to uphold the university\u2019s mission and values. While academic and student residential building projects on campus are driven by the Academic Strategic Plan, and the academic and research mission of the university, the FutureVU land use plan provides a consistent strategy and guiding principles necessary for the realization of all capital projects and changes to the built environment. More recently, FutureVU, the overarching campus planning process, was expanded to be a more holistic model, developing the spaces on campus and investing in the initiatives that support the people who live, work and learn in them. A Framework for the Future FutureVU provides a framework for the future of Vanderbilt, while considering core themes such as inclusion and accessibility, sustainability, transportation and mobility, connectivity and community enhancement, engagement with surrounding communities, and preservation of the historic park-like setting",
