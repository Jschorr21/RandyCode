Dare to Grow Give Now A Fall School Update from Dean Pam Jeffries August 2024 Dear alumni, friends and supporters, It has been a wonderful year for Vanderbilt School of Nursing, topped off with graduating 449 students in May\u2014including 30 new Master of Nursing registered nurses. Adding these RNs to the workforce is one step in easing the nursing shortage and a continuation of our history of educating, innovating and remaining dedicated to meeting the needs of our profession, communities and burdened health care system. With each success, we are further emboldened to address new challenges and attract more of the brightest students and faculty into our programs. Your support is vital to our efforts.

After witnessing vastly different social structures and circumstances, he was inspired to pursue a career in mental health through our Psychiatric-Mental Health NP program.

At VUSN, we are growing our endowed funds available for scholarships, thereby creating opportunities for both current and future generations of students. Almost 85 percent of VUSN students receive some form of financial assistance and the school is dedicated to providing opportunity to future nurse leaders. Faculty Support/Endowed Chairs The recognition and honor an endowed chair confers upon the faculty member holding it are vital incentives in a dynamic market where the best faculty are in great demand. On any given day, the vast majority of the school's faculty can be found in their offices and classrooms, available to students and energetically involved in the life of the school. Endowed chairs enable us to retain such exceptional professors and to attract talented new faculty which places the School of Nursing at a decided advantage. The Annual Fund Annual fund gifts are unrestricted contributions of any size, to the School of Nursing, that are made on a yearly basis. Each academic year, VUSN has new needs that require support. Endowment gifts are earmarked for a specific use, while Annual Fund gifts provide funds that can be used by the dean and administrators to address the most immediate needs and opportunities",
