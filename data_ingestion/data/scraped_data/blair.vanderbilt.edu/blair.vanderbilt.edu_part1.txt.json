    "text": "Admissions Overview Who We Are The Blair School of Music is solely for undergraduates The talented musicians we attract want world-class music training with excellent teachers, frequent performance opportunities, and great facilities. They want to participate in their school's top ensembles, so we deliberately limit our admissions numbers. Because we are selective, our students study and perform with musicians who are equally dedicated. The student-to-faculty ratio of 4:1 provides numerous opportunities to get to know and to work closely with the world-class musicians on our faculty. Blair students are bright and versatile, with wide-ranging interests and ideas Some combine music in a double major or add a minor in Vanderbilt's College of Arts and Sciences or the Peabody College of Education and Human Development; (the only second major available to Blair students in the School of Engineering is Computer Science.) We believe Blair students' artistry is enriched by the intersection between the arts and other academic disciplines; students will graduate with Vanderbilt's strong foundation in the liberal arts and sciences supporting Blair's intense training in music. Blair graduates can be found throughout the fields of performance, research, teaching and composition Blair students have been accepted for graduate study at major schools of music in the United States and Europe",

The Undergraduate Catalog is the binding document for all policies related to your curriculum and degree requirements. The Blair Student Handbook also provides detailed information and curriculum plans. Additional information and forms are available through the Academics section of the Blair website . What Should I Do if I Want to Double Major? Please make an appointment with Professor Brian Utley to discuss ways to manage your schedule for the remaining semesters. As you select your courses, look for those that count double between areas in your liberal arts core. When you double count a course, you do not double the number of credits earned, but you satisfy the requirements in two categories. For example, English courses double count for English and Humanities. You will earn three credits for the course, thus satisfying half of your English requirement and part of the Humanities category; you will then have three credits available for an academic elective that applies to a second major. How Do I Declare a Second Major or Minor? Declaring as soon as possible will give you a better chance of enrolling in the classes you need to complete the second major or minor.

All of these majors require a minimum of 80 credit hours in music, with instruction in a major instrument/voice or composition and additional courses in musicology, music theory, conducting, ensembles, and pedagogy. However, in the performance and composition majors, applied lessons are three or four credits per semester, while in integrated studies, lessons are two credits each semester. In integrated studies there is a more equal balance between courses in performance/composition and a required second area in music, which is satisfied by declaring one of the concentrations in music. (See the Blair Student Handbook for options.) For Integrated Studies/Teacher Education majors, the concentration is Teacher Education. How Is the Musical Arts Degree Different From the B.mus. Degree? The Musical Arts degree gives outstanding musicians the opportunity to focus on music courses in 50 percent of their coursework (at least 63 hours), with flexibility to also concentrate on a specific area outside of music (minimum 18 credit hours). This discrete area of competence can be a second major, minor, pre-professional track, or self-designed interdisciplinary area.

You may waive performance class only if you have a required academic class for a second major or minor or pre-professional program (e.g. pre-med), and there is no other section available in that class. Complete the waiver form and submit it to the Blair Office of Academic Services. You may register for section 02 only if you have a required class for a second major or minor or pre-professional program (e.g. pre-med) during the recital hour. Email professor Tucker Biddlecombe to request permission to enroll in section 02. You may enroll in one zero-credit ensemble beyond the 18 credit hours, with the permission of Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education Tucker Biddlecombe . YES will allow you to register in only 18 credit hours, so register for all courses except the one ensemble you would like to take as zero credit. You must petition Associate Dean Biddlecombe for permission to take more than 18 credit hours in a semester, and the Blair Office of Academic Services will coordinate the enrollment for you, if approved. If you are taking only one required ensemble and it is for zero credit, be aware that you may need to make up that hour later on so that you have a minimum of 80 hours in music to graduate. If you are a first-year student petitioning for the second semester, you will need to make the request after final grades are posted for the fall semester",

You may choose to place yourself on the wait list for the class (this will not happen automatically). You must email the instructor and ask for permission to enroll. Often they will assign you a specific code for registration. Sometimes you will need to forward their email with permission to enroll to the Blair Office of Academic Services . If you are taking an elective instrument for the first time, enroll in the 00 section (TBA section for placement) of the instrument. For example, piano is PIAN 1100 section 00. You should follow the instructions listed for that section to audition/interview. No, the times will rotate each semester. Some classes have seats reserved specifically for majors and minors during the appointment windows portion of registration. Extra seats will be available only during open registration. If you are working toward a second major or minor, it is always best to declare as soon as possible so that you will have priority for enrolling in the classes you need. Wait list options are determined by Vanderbilt departments. If there is no wait list for a class, you will need to check the class periodically for open seats. No, it means that your action created an error. You should read the message carefully to see why there is an error",

Most Blair courses are housed at Blair, so travel time for those is negligible. Make sure all courses meet at times that are available in your schedule.
