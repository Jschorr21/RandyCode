They want to participate in their school's top ensembles, so we deliberately limit our admissions numbers. Because we are selective, our students study and perform with musicians who are equally dedicated. The student-to-faculty ratio of 4:1 provides numerous opportunities to get to know and to work closely with the world-class musicians on our faculty. Blair students are bright and versatile, with wide-ranging interests and ideas Some combine music in a double major or add a minor in Vanderbilt's College of Arts and Sciences or the Peabody College of Education and Human Development; (the only second major available to Blair students in the School of Engineering is Computer Science.) We believe Blair students' artistry is enriched by the intersection between the arts and other academic disciplines; students will graduate with Vanderbilt's strong foundation in the liberal arts and sciences supporting Blair's intense training in music. Blair graduates can be found throughout the fields of performance, research, teaching and composition Blair students have been accepted for graduate study at major schools of music in the United States and Europe",

The Undergraduate Catalog is the binding document for all policies related to your curriculum and degree requirements.

What Should I Do if I Want to Double Major? Please make an appointment with Professor Brian Utley to discuss ways to manage your schedule for the remaining semesters. As you select your courses, look for those that count double between areas in your liberal arts core. When you double count a course, you do not double the number of credits earned, but you satisfy the requirements in two categories. For example, English courses double count for English and Humanities. You will earn three credits for the course, thus satisfying half of your English requirement and part of the Humanities category; you will then have three credits available for an academic elective that applies to a second major. How Do I Declare a Second Major or Minor? Declaring as soon as possible will give you a better chance of enrolling in the classes you need to complete the second major or minor.

All of these majors require a minimum of 80 credit hours in music, with instruction in a major instrument/voice or composition and additional courses in musicology, music theory, conducting, ensembles, and pedagogy. However, in the performance and composition majors, applied lessons are three or four credits per semester, while in integrated studies, lessons are two credits each semester. In integrated studies there is a more equal balance between courses in performance/composition and a required second area in music, which is satisfied by declaring one of the concentrations in music. (See the Blair Student Handbook for options.) For Integrated Studies/Teacher Education majors, the concentration is Teacher Education. How Is the Musical Arts Degree Different From the B.mus. Degree? The Musical Arts degree gives outstanding musicians the opportunity to focus on music courses in 50 percent of their coursework (at least 63 hours), with flexibility to also concentrate on a specific area outside of music (minimum 18 credit hours). This discrete area of competence can be a second major, minor, pre-professional track, or self-designed interdisciplinary area.

Blair students are fortunate to have both an academic adviser and a studio adviser. Your studio adviser can help you with questions related to your major area (ensemble choices, graduate school auditions, summer festivals, etc.), while the academic adviser helps you with course registration and gives you a musical and academic perspective beyond your major area. The advisers work together to provide the resources you need to successfully complete your degree requirements. Whom Do I Talk to About Study Abroad? The Global Education Office in the Student Life Center is your first stop for information about study abroad. Check out the information in the Blair Student Handbook about the specific programs that are affiliated with Blair, and feel free to discuss it with Assistant Dean for Academic Affairs Brian Utley.

Some classes have seats reserved specifically for majors and minors during the appointment windows portion of registration. Extra seats will be available only during open registration. If you are working toward a second major or minor, it is always best to declare as soon as possible so that you will have priority for enrolling in the classes you need.

No, it means that your action created an error. You should read the message carefully to see why there is an error. You might not meet the prerequisites for the class, or perhaps the class requires permission of the instructor. Check the message carefully.
