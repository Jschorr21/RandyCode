Wyatt Statement of the Honor Code Vanderbilt University students pursue all academic endeavors with integrity.¬† They conduct themselves honorably, professionally, and respectfully in all realms of their studies in order to promote and secure an atmosphere of dignity and trust.¬† The keystone of our honor system is self regulation, which requires cooperation and support from each member of the University community.

We coordinate academic, social, and other activities significant to the graduate community. We strive to promote community among graduate students, as well as graduate student integration into the university community. All graduate students are welcome to attend and participate in GSC meetings, parties, and academic events. We work to ascertain and represent graduate student opinions and concerns, facilitating communication between graduate students, administration, and faculty. How can you participate? Come to our General Body Meetings in Alumni Hall Room 201 from 6-7pm, first Tuesdays of the month (unless otherwise stated).
