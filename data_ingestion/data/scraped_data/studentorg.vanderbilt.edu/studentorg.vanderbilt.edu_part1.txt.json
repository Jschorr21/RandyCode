    "text": "Undergraduate Honor Council  Since the first classes began at Vanderbilt in 1875, the Honor System has served to strengthen the academic integrity of the university.¬†Today, the Honor Council serves two simultaneous aims: to uphold and protect the Honor Code and to educate members of the Vanderbilt community about the Honor System. The links above are designed to provide information and help answer questions about the Vanderbilt Honor System and its mission. ‚ÄúPerhaps Vanderbilt‚Äôs most important role in the interest of our free society is to give the world educated men and women of character, possessing a fundamental integrity that affects both their thoughts and actions.‚Äù -Chancellor Joe B. Wyatt Statement of the Honor Code Vanderbilt University students pursue all academic endeavors with integrity.¬† They conduct themselves honorably, professionally, and respectfully in all realms of their studies in order to promote and secure an atmosphere of dignity and trust.¬† The keystone of our honor system is self regulation, which requires cooperation and support from each member of the University community. Contact Us The Undergraduate Honor Council is a registered student organization supported and advised by staff in Student Accountability, Community Standards, and Academic Integrity . Questions or concerns about the Honor Code may be directed to honor.council@vanderbilt.edu.
