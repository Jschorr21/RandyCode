Wyatt Statement of the Honor Code Vanderbilt University students pursue all academic endeavors with integrity.\u00a0 They conduct themselves honorably, professionally, and respectfully in all realms of their studies in order to promote and secure an atmosphere of dignity and trust.\u00a0 The keystone of our honor system is self regulation, which requires cooperation and support from each member of the University community.
