The oldest student statement on behavioral expectations is the Honor Code, adopted by the student body in 1875. More recently, the student body adopted the Community Creed to guide shared behavioral expectations both inside and outside of the classroom. As the University community and spaces continue to evolve, Student Affairs has partnered with students to promulgate the Good Neighbor Guidelines and Digital Citizenship Statement. Honor Code Statement of the Honor Code Vanderbilt University students pursue all academic endeavors with integrity. They conduct themselves honorably, professionally, and respectfully in all realms of their studies in order to promote and secure an atmosphere of dignity and trust. The keystone of the honor system is self-regulation, which requires cooperation and support from each member of the University community. Undergraduate Honor Code Pledge I pledge to pursue all academic endeavors with honor and integrity.

I understand the principles of the Honor System, and I promise to uphold these standards by adhering to the Honor Code in order to preserve the integrity of Vanderbilt University and its individual members.

History of the Honor Code The Vanderbilt Honor System was instituted in 1875 with the first final examinations administered by the University. Dean Madison Sarratt summarized the system as follows, \u201cLet every individual who contemplates entering Vanderbilt University ask himself[/herself/themselves] first this important question: \u2018Am I strong enough to give my word of honor and then live up to it in spite of every temptation that may arise?\u2019\u201d The purpose of the Honor Code is to preserve and promote academic integrity. Ideally, a student\u2019s personal integrity is presumed to be sufficient assurance that in academic matters one does one\u2019s own work without unauthorized help. The Undergraduate Honor Council and the graduate and professional school h onor c ouncils are organizations that seek to preserve the integrity of the Honor Code at Vanderbilt University",

The Honor System is one of the many layered structures provided to Vanderbilt students to aid in the development of creative thinking, intellectual maturity, personal accountability, and respect for honesty, integrity, and truth. The goal of the Honor System is to have all students leave Vanderbilt not only as graduates, but also as citizens of integrity.

Examples of these common actions that reflect plagiarism are explored further on the Undergraduate Honor Council\u2019s resource page. A student may not submit papers substantially the same in content for credit in more than one course, without specific and prior permission of all instructors concerned. Students should understand that sources of common knowledge can be plagiarized. Generally, an idea is considered common knowledge if it is encountered at least five times in separate sources during one's research into a particular subject. (Reprints of one source do not constitute separate sources.) Copying or close paraphrasing of the wording or presentation of a source of common knowledge constitutes plagiarism. What constitutes common knowledge may also vary by discipline so students should consult their instructors to determine whether a citation is needed. Regardless of intent or premeditation, plagiarism is a violation of the Honor Code. Students, therefore, must be conscious of their responsibilities as scholars under the Honor System, to learn to discern what is included in plagiarism as well as in other breaches of the Honor Code, and must know and practice the specifications for citations in scholarly work",

Behavior related to Interpersonal Interactions Open: Vanderbilt students strive to openly engage with ideas, experiences, and with one another. They welcome every background and story through celebration of the diversity that enriches our common experience and active participation in constructive conversations about our differences. Acts that demean, dehumanize, or otherwise harm a person\u2019s ability to participate fully and authentically in our community, regardless of intent, do not align with Vanderbilt students\u2019 commitment to openness. Abuse Students may not engage in the abuse of another person, and abuse that causes a reasonable person to fear for one\u2019s safety or bodily autonomy is a violation of this policy. Abuse includes, but is not limited to, unwanted physical contact of a non-sexual nature, striking or attempting to strike another person, restricting the movement or attempting to restrict the movement of another person so that they cannot leave the immediate area , intimidation through threats or other means, and words, symbols, graphics, or other communications that threaten violence",

Harassment is unwelcome verbal, physical, electronic, or other conduct toward another that is so severe, persistent, or pervasive that it alters the conditions of education or participation in a University program or activity. A person's subjective belief that behavior is intimidating, hostile, or abusive does not necessarily make that behavior harassment. Students are also expected to refrain from conduct that otherwise unreasonably impairs the security or privacy of another member of the University community by any means, including through the use of electronic communications, social media, computers, or data networks, or by recording unauthorized video or photographic images in a location in which the other community member has a reasonable expectation of privacy, or by publishing such images.

In partnership with faculty and staff from across the University, Housing and Residential Experience professionals work to build learning communities where values of scholarship and leadership are nurtured in a culture of collegiality. Residential Experience staff foster interactions among students and faculty and support students\u2019 scholarly pursuits and personal growth. Values of civility, belonging, accountability, discovery, and celebration are at work in Vanderbilt\u2019s residential community. Housing and Residential Experience employs a compassionate group of upper-division, graduate, and professional students as Resident Advisers (RAs), Head Residents (HRs), and Graduate Area Coordinators (GACs). Professional, in-residence staff supervise the aforenoted paraprofessional staff. The collective Residential Experience staff, in cooperation with Residential Colleges and other campus partners, organizes and coordinates social, educational, and recreational programs throughout the residences.  Residential Requirement The Residential Requirement, established by the Board of Trust in 1959 , states that \u201cAll unmarried undergraduate students are required to live in residence halls on campus during the academic year, May session, and summer sessions",

Authorization to live elsewhere is granted at the discretion of the Director of Housing Assignments and Operations in special situations, or when space is unavailable on campus.\u201d Living in and engaging with an on-campus residential community is regarded as an integral part of a Vanderbilt undergraduate education and to that end, Housing and Residential Experience provides this critical opportunity to as many undergraduate students as possible. In general, first-year students are housed separately from upper-division students. Only under extreme circumstances when there is insufficient space in the designated first-year student housing system or in special situations, first-year students may be housed with upper-division students. All undergraduate housing arrangements are overseen by Housing and Residential Experience office. Housing Assignments There are three possible housing statuses for undergraduate students taking classes on campus: (1) living on campus in a University residence hall, (2) living on campus in a Greek chapter facility, and (3) having authorization from the Director of Housing Assignments and Operations to live off-campus. Students studying abroad, participating in an internship away from Nashville, or on a leave of absence do not have a housing status during the term(s) when they are not taking classes on campus.

Procedures for first-year student housing assignments will usually be posted on the Housing and Residential Experience website by no later than February 1, of the year in which students will enter the University. Admission to the University does not guarantee assignment to a particular type of room or building as the University population is fluid, and demand for housing may change considerably in a relatively short period of time. A variety of room types exist on the Ingram Commons including singles, doubles, and triples. It may be necessary to house students in \u00a0upper-division areas, or in alternative accommodations (such as study rooms on residential floors) for a few weeks, for a semester, or for the entire first year should class size exceed available rooms on the Ingram Commons.

Inspections and Searches The University recognizes and respects the desire for privacy.

Staff conduct inspections for a variety of reasons that include, but are not limited to, fire and safety issues, health and welfare issues, maintenance or damage issues, cleanliness, and closing for breaks and end of an academic session. Although inspections are generally announced, circumstances may dictate that an inspection be unannounced. A search of a student, a student's possessions, or a student's premises may be authorized by the Vice Provost and Dean of Students or designee, if there is reasonable cause to believe that a violation of University policy is occurring or has occurred.

Noise It is impossible to set specific standards regarding levels of noise in a residence hall which will satisfy all residents. Individual levels of noise tolerance vary widely. The purpose of the residence halls is to offer conditions which permit reasonable order for study and sleep. Quiet hours are in effect from 7pm until 7am, Sunday through Thursday, and midnight until 10am, Friday and Saturday. During these hours, residents must cease all activities that might disturb study or sleep. Radios, televisions, etc., should be turned to low volume and other noisy activity curtailed. During reading and examination periods, quiet hours are in effect twenty-four (24) hours a day. Residents may vote to alter quiet hours, however, these alterations must be unanimous.

Off-Campus Fundraising If an organization has exhausted sources of funding on campus, it may be possible to solicit funds from sources off campus. Funds can be obtained in several ways: through solicitation of parents and alumni, solicitation of area merchants and large corporations, and invitations for co-sponsorship or gifts in kind from businesses. Some off-campus fundraising is subject for approval through the Office of Annual Giving. The Office of Annual Giving holds access to limited historical records of Registered Student Organization membership, and may be able to provide a Registered Student Organization with mailing data of the organization's alumni. To obtain the mailing data (usually provided as a set of labels), a group may submit a request to Student Organizations, Leadership and Service to determine if there is a list of its organization's alumni. If approved, the mailing data will be provided. The Office of Annual Giving requires two week\u2019s notice to process requests, so student organizations should submit requests to Student Organizations, Leadership and Service at least four weeks in advance. Provided mail and email lists are made available by the Office of Annual Giving for one-time use, only",

If after thirty days the project has not been completed, a new list must be requested. By statute, the University is required to update alumni, parent, and friend communications preferences (such as mail or email subscription drops), continually. Using an out-of-date list subjects the University to the risk of potential violation of statutes such as the CAN-SPAM Act. Registered Student Organizations may obtain authorization to solicit funds from the parents of its membership by submitting the Fundraiser/Solicitation Form in Anchor Link. The proposal must include a statement of the purpose of the appeal, a sample of the solicitation mailing, and the proposed date of the appeal. Student Organizations, Leadership and Service will forward the proposal to the Office of Annual Giving for review. Area merchants and corporations can contribute to Registered Student Organization endeavors in two ways: by a simple donation of money, items, or merchandise, or by a donation of money, items or merchandise in return for some recognition, an arrangement sometimes known as co-sponsorship",

In addition to using the Commodore Card for identification, students may use their credentials to access Commodore Cash debit spending funds, to make use of their VU Meal Plan, to gain admission to campus buildings such as residence halls, academic buildings, libraries, athletic events and the David Williams II Recreation and Wellness Center, and to gain admission or record attendance at events across the campus. Many on-campus and off-campus locations accept the Commodore Card as a method of payment, including dining locations, the Vanderbilt Bookstore, Varsity Markets, vending, VUprint stations and copy machines, Sarratt Ticket Office, the campus post office, athletics concessions, Outdoor Recreation Center and restaurants participating in the Taste of Nashville program. For information on funding your Commodore Cash debit spending account, visit the Commodore Card website. To ensure that Commodore Cash debit spending funds and access privileges can be protected, students must report lost cards as soon as possible either to Vanderbilt Card Services during business hours, online, or in the GET app",

Freedom of expression applies even when that expression directly challenges the beliefs and ideas of another and even when that expression may be deemed disagreeable or possibly even offensive.

Dissents. Dissents are short and spontaneous non-violent verbal or non-verbal reactions to a speaker. Expression. Collectively, any Demonstration, Dissent, Protest, Counterprotest, or Installation as defined within this policy. Protests.

A pet residing in the residential facilities, including service or emotional support animals with rescinded approval, must be removed within 24 hours. A pet found to pose a risk to the safety of a person or property may be required to be removed from campus immediately, including public areas. Tennessee state law (Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 62-7-112) provides that persons accompanied by a dog guide in training may not be refused entrance to a place of public accommodation because the dog guide trainer is being led or accompanied by a dog guide in training, provided: the dog guide in training, when led or accompanied by a dog guide trainer, is wearing a harness and is held on a leash by the dog guide trainer or, when led or accompanied by a dog guide trainer, is held on a leash by the dog guide trainer; and the dog guide trainer has first presented for inspection credentials issued by an accredited school for training dog guides",

Requests to add coverage based on a qualifying event must be received within 31 days of the qualifying event. Forms received more than 31 days after the qualifying event will not be processed. Student Wellbeing Interventions Students who engage in conduct that endangers the health and safety of themselves or others, or who otherwise are unable to function as a student may, among other things, be expected to participate and make satisfactory progress in a program of medical/mental evaluation and/or treatment as a condition of continued enrollment. The Student Care Network endeavors to assist students who are at risk for self-harm or harming others. However, the University, in its discretion, may require the immediate withdrawal of a student when, following an individualized assessment, the University determines the student poses a direct threat to themselves or others or who otherwise is unable to function as a student",

Students who withdraw\u2014voluntarily or involuntarily\u2014under these circumstances, will be able to reenroll following a finding by the University that the condition(s) for reenrollment have been met. The University maintains two primary means of institutional review for assessment and implementation of this intervention process: the CARE Team and the Welfare Panel. The Campus Assessment, Response, and Evaluation (CARE) Team is a multidisciplinary team of campus professionals (faculty and staff) dedicated to a proactive and collaborative approach for the prevention, identification, assessment, and management of challenges impacting students\u2019 academic and personal success. The purpose of the CARE Team is to facilitate purposeful information sharing regarding students of concern and where a thorough or extensive collaborative support strategy may be needed. Students are discussed in CARE Team meetings with the intent of creating appropriate and individualized support plans for each student. The CARE Team meets regularly during the academic year. More information about assisting students of concern and submitting a student of concern report can be found SCC webpage",

A Welfare Panel will be convened by the Vice Provost and Dean of Students or designee (Dean), when the Dean, through an individualized assessment, determines that a student (1) is a danger to the health and safety of themselves or others or (2) is otherwise unable to function as a student and (3 ) the inclusion of treatment recommendations or evaluations may be beneficial to stop the concern and prevent its reoccurrence in addition to outlining behavioral expectations or actions. The University may place a student on an Interim Restriction(s) effective until the Welfare Panel has made a final decision on the Intervention Plan or determined reasons for imposing the Interim Restriction(s) no longer exist. A Welfare Panel is comprised of individuals who would provide for an individualized assessment of the situation and the student. The composition of the Welfare Panel in any individual case is set by the Dean and is confidential, though individuals may choose to disclose their participation to a student. The Welfare Panel may consult with others not included in the initial composition of the Welfare Panel while conducting its individualized assessment",

Using well-reasoned judgment and taking into account the individual circumstances, the Welfare Panel will enact an individualized assessment and plan (Intervention Plan) that addresses whether a student (1) may remain enrolled without conditions, (2) may remain enrolled with conditions that are to be described in writing, or (3) should or must take a leave. In making a decision about the contents of an Intervention Plan, the Welfare Panel will consider available relevant information. When appropriate, the student may be asked to sign a health records release to authorize direct communication between and among the Welfare Panel and the student\u2019s healthcare provider(s). If a student declines to provide requested information and/or authorizations, the Welfare Panel will make their determination after considering the available relevant information.

Isolation and Quarantine Vanderbilt University must enforce public health mandates as required by public health authorities and may also follow VUMC and SHC recommendations when the University determines them to be in the best interest of the Vanderbilt community and the public. Based on the aforementioned mandates and/or recommendations, the University may issue directives to students regarding isolation and/or quarantine. As a result, among other needed interventions, students in campus housing, or students traveling as part of Vanderbilt programs or activities, may be required to relocate so that appropriate isolation and/or quarantine can be accomplished. Failure to comply with University directives may result in corrective action through the University\u2019s accountability process.
