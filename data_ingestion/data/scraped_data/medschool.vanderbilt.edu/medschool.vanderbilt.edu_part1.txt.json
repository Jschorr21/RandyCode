You\u2019re choosing a place that will be the beginning act in the drama of your medical career. It\u2019s no longer simply preparation \u2013 it\u2019s an experience that merges learning and practice. Like many of the faculty (and deans) at Vanderbilt, as a graduate of this medical school I have a deep connection to the traditions and the experiences of its students. We have a personal, vested interest in training physicians who are not only exceptional clinicians, but also \u201cspecialists\u201d at building relationships with people. We provide that kind of education through a highly personal, yet broad intellectual experience that enables leadership in the fast-paced change taking place in all corners of biomedical science and health care. Medicine needs the next generation of physicians to be people who both excel and lead in the clinical setting as innovators of new processes and technologies designed to support and enhance clinical care.

The Vanderbilt medical curriculum is a model for institutions across the country for its emphasis on lifelong learning and extensive exposure to real world patient care experience throughout all four years of medical school. Your journey will be rife with first experiences, from seeing your first cadaver, your first physical examination of a patient, the first time you help deliver a baby, and yes, the first time you support a patient at the end of life. But the important \u201cfirsts\u201d will keep coming long after you leave the halls of medical school. The Vanderbilt experience is crafted to impart the skills and confidence you will need to manage new and evolving healthcare trends with a mind conditioned to make decisions that consider the broadest array of evidence \u2013 including social and behavioral factors as well as the biological and data sciences. Medicine is a life of service \u2013 and at times sacrifice. We sometimes miss the evening meal or the soccer game as we are called to be there when our patients need us. And yet it\u2019s a life full of rich rewards because of the profound and direct difference we can make in people\u2019s lives. Whether you\u2019re still weighing medicine as your career path or assessing which institution best fits you: know that Vanderbilt is a medical school with tradition and culture built around mutual support as together we engage and shape the next frontiers in science and health care.

The Beginning Vanderbilt University Medical Center began in 1874 when the School of Medicine, which had been part of the University of Nashville since its founding in 1851, was incorporated into Vanderbilt University, which had been founded in 1873 with a grant from Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt. The first degree awarded by this new University, in 1875, went to Henry William Morgan, and was a medical degree. For many years of its existence, Vanderbilt\u2019s medical school and hospital were located near the present day intersection of Fifth Avenue and Elm Street, near downtown Nashville. During this time, the School of Medicine was owned and operated as a private property of the practicing physicians who made up the faculty and received the fees of the students\u2014a system that, while not ideal, was typical of medical education in the U.S. at the time. In 1895, the School of Medicine was reorganized under the Vanderbilt University Board of Trust. William L. Dudley, who was professor of Chemistry in the college of Arts and Sciences, was appointed medical dean; admission requirements were raised to require a high school diploma; the course was lengthened to three years of six months each; and laboratory work in the basic sciences was added to the curriculum",

At this time, Vanderbilt was one of four medical schools in Nashville , joined by the University of Nashville, which again separated from Vanderbilt in 1895, the University of Tennessee, and Meharry Medical College. Three years later, in 1898, the quality of education was again upgraded . The course requirement for graduation increased from three years to four years and the number of months of instruction each year increased from six to seven. Improving the quality of instruction and therefore the quality of graduates of the School of Medicine received a boost with the 1910 publication of the report of Abraham Flexner, who, with a grant from the Carnegie Foundation, surveyed American medical education and proposed that the training of physicians become more rigorous, standardized, and scientific. Flexner\u2019s comments concerning Vanderbilt were not without criticism, but the report noted that Vanderbilt was the best suited facility in the state to train Tennessee\u2019s doctors . The 1920s The Flexner report was taken to heart by Dr. G. Canby Robinson, who was appointed Dean of the School of Medicine in 1920",

Five years later, on September 16, 1925, the aspirations of the Flexner Report, the will of Canby Robinson, and the funding of Rockefeller Foundation General Education Board and the Carnegie Foundation came to life, as the School of Medicine was relocated to a new building on the Vanderbilt main campus that housed not only the school, but the hospital, outpatient clinics, laboratory, and library . That building survives as Medical Center North, although most of its original functions have since relocated to dedicated buildings of their own as the Medical Center has grown. The 1925 state-of-the-art facility was located adjacent to the building for the Vanderbilt University School of Nursing, also completed in 1925. The school, which was founded in 1909, was one of the nation\u2019s first nursing programs to incorporate its curriculum into a liberal arts degree. While part of the college of Arts and Sciences until officially joining the Medical Center in 1984, the School of Nursing throughout its history was closely affiliated with the patient care activities of the Medical Center. The years between the reorganization of the Medical Center and the beginning of the Second World War were active ones at VUMC. Waller Leathers replaced Canby Robinson as Dean in 1928, the same year the department of Pediatrics was established",

The 1930s & 1940s The first major addition to the Medical Center building was made in 1938, as the D corridor was added at the rear of the structure to house, among other things, more patient rooms and the departments of Pediatrics and Obstetrics and Gynecology. One of VUMC\u2019s first major research grants was received in 1932 from the Rockefeller Foundation. The $250,000 earmarked for clinical research was administered by a faculty committee. Two of the most significant clinical research developments in American medicine during this era came from Vanderbilt: In 1944, Dr. Alfred Blalock and his research assistant Vivien Thomas conducted pioneering research leading to the first cardiothoracic surgery for infants born with \u201cblue baby syndrome.\u201d Blalock\u2019s work was essential to the development of open heart surgery. In the early 1940s, Dr. Ernest Goodpasture, who became Dean in 1944, developed the method of culturing vaccines in chick embryos, which allowed the mass production of vaccines for smallpox, typhus, and yellow fever",

In the early 1940s, Dr. Ernest Goodpasture, who became Dean in 1944, developed the method of culturing vaccines in chick embryos, which allowed the mass production of vaccines for smallpox, typhus, and yellow fever. The coming of war reduced the number of students and faculty on the Vanderbilt campus, and, as had been the case in World War I, VUMC faculty and staff had an organized presence in the war effort. In 1941 the Vanderbilt 300th General Hospital unit was organized and participated in the European theater. The first major development after the war was the 1945 establishment of the department of Anesthesiology. The department was new, but anesthesiology as a specialty had been one of the best known areas of VUMC; the first ether-oxygen apparatus, an early anesthesia machine, had been developed at VUMC in 1907 by Dr. James Tayloe Gwathmey. More great names of Vanderbilt also made an appearance during this era. Dr. Amos U. Christie, chair of Pediatrics, led a team that achieved worldwide notice for pioneering work in histoplasmosis. The 1950s & 1960s Dr. John B. Youmans became Dean in 1950; Dr. Barney Brooks retired as chair of Surgery and was replaced by Dr. H. William Scott Jr.; and Dr. Elliot Newman received the series of grants from the U.S. Public Health Service that led, in 1960, to the establishment of the federally funded Clinical Research Center which bears Newman\u2019s name. Dr. John Patterson was named Dean in 1958",

Dr. John Patterson was named Dean in 1958. The first endowed chair in the School of Medicine was established in 1960, the George W. Hale Professorship in Ophthalmology. In 1961, the Learned Lab was added to Medical Center North and the next year the West Wing, later more descriptively dubbed the Round Wing, opened. These additions added to both research and patient care space. Patient care of newborns was revolutionized in 1961 at VUMC as Dr. Mildred T. Stahlman founded the division of Neonatology and began the Vanderbilt NICU, the first in the nation to make use of respiratory therapy for infants with damaged lungs. In 1963, Dr. Randolph Batson was named Dean and Director of Medical Affairs, a position which evolved into the current position of Vice Chancellor for Health Affairs. The 1960s saw several additions to the Medical Center. The Werthan Wing was added to Medical Center North in 1964, and in 1967 Medical Center South was renovated and became part of the Medical Center. That same year, the Zerfoss Student Health Center, named in honor of Dr. Thomas B. Zerfoss, who was a University physician from 1926 to 1962, opened.

Dr. Stanley Cohen received a Nobel Prize in 1986, as he shared the award with Dr. Rita Levi-Montalcini of Italy for their discovery of epidermal growth factor. The School of Nursing, which under the leadership of Dean Colleen Conway-Welch became a part of the Medical Center in 1984, phased out its undergraduate nursing degree in 1989 and became exclusively a graduate school with a mission of educating advanced level nurses.

The School of Nursing also added a course of study leading to a Ph.D. in Nursing Science, and combined with the School of Engineering to offer a course of study leading to an M.S.N. in Nursing and a Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering. Dr. Harry R. Jacobson succeeded Robinson as Vice Chancellor for Health Affairs in 1997, and took over a Medical Center that was in many ways more successful than ever in its history, but also facing unique challenges.

In response, the Medical Center took steps to create clinical pathways to streamline and improve the efficiency of patient care, reorganized faculty physicians into the Vanderbilt Medical Group, and located practices into communities away from the campus to be more convenient for patients. At the same time, government funding of research grew more competitive, even as VUMC faculty research dollars grew, and Vanderbilt began to reach out to private and entrepreneurial sources of research funds. But as VUMC continued to do what it has done throughout its history\u2014adjust to the changing times and look ahead to a bright future\u2014there was much evidence that the institution\u2019s tradition of quality continued: U.S. News and World Report has consistently ranked the School of Medicine in the top 20 in the nation during the 1990s, and likewise Vanderbilt\u2019s patient care in a number of specialties was highly ranked in that magazine\u2019s annual reports.

        "text": "Vanderbilt Human Genetics Program  Human Genetics PhD Program Rationale Genetics is the core of biology. Human genetics as a discipline is a central feature of modern biology and now of modern medicine as well. Human genetics and genomics, along with the related field of precision medicine, continue to generate both great excitement and genuine discovery. In current research practice, human genetics often forms the bridge between traditional wet-lab biological research and medicine. Post-graduate education in human genetics is an increasingly attractive route to the PhD due to the broad and interdisciplinary nature of this research and to the increasing capability of non-clinical researchers to contribute to medically relevant research. Graduate students recognize that the interdisciplinary nature of modern human genetics research prepares them for a rich and varied research career instead of funneling them into a very tight sub-specialty field. The translational nature of modern human genetics satisfies the need to contribute to health and medical care which we often see described as a major motivation for our graduate student to enter a PhD program. Recent events have only strengthened the urgency that young scientists feel to contribute to biomedical research in a meaningful way. The Vanderbilt Human Genetics PhD program (HGEN) has served as a model of successful interdisciplinary biomedical research to graduate students since its inception",

        "text": ". The Vanderbilt Human Genetics PhD program (HGEN) has served as a model of successful interdisciplinary biomedical research to graduate students since its inception. Modern human genetics research relies more and more on large scale biobanks combined with de-identified medical records, and HGEN has been intensively training graduate students in these research methods for over 10 years, far earlier than other institutions. We were able to start training graduate students in this new research area early due to the founding of our own large local biobank, BioVU, in 2008. That valuable research experience has allowed the students supported by this training grant to go forward into successful research careers as the increasing development of both regional and national biobank research efforts have increased, placing their educational experience in high demand. HGEN Training Program Mission There is a growing need nationally for scientists educated in computational biology, with genetics being one of the most quantitative and computational areas of modern biology. Vanderbilt University (VU) and Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) have invested hugely in human genetic and genomic science",

With the establishment in 2015 of the Vanderbilt Genetics Institute (VGI), Vanderbilt has committed substantial new resources for establishing a research institute crossing both institutions, recruitment of additional faculty in genetics and genomics, and additional investment in genomic data for subjects in BioVU to facilitate further research by faculty and graduate students. HGEN students have enjoyed unusual success in both productivity in graduate school (an average of 5.1 publications per student from graduate school research) and in being hired into academic human genetics programs (32% of HGEN alumni graduating >10 years ago now have faculty positions). The goal of the Ph.D. Program in Human Genetics is to train students to explore scientific questions in genetics, with an emphasis on human disease. The program is designed to ensure technical proficiency in statistical and molecular techniques, provide current knowledge of genetics research and methods, and develop scientific communication skills. The program provides a cohesive experience that leverages the many facets of human genetics research at Vanderbilt, for the benefit of trainees and research mentors.",
