Peabody\u2019s emphasis on research differentiates us from other schools and ensures that our students benefit from early access to the latest findings. We build research around real-world problems to improve lives and strengthen practice. Peabody\u2019s focus on learning differences has helped define the college, as has our reputation for empirical rigor in educational neuroscience; child, family, and community development; special education; the learning sciences; and educational leadership and policy. Faculty Directory Peabody Research Office (PRO) PRO provides research support to faculty and research staff at Peabody College. Support includes identifying grant opportunities from internal and external\u00a0 funding sources and assisting with developing and submitting award winning proposals.
