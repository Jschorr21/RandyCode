Students who enroll in the Division of Unclassified Studies are classified into one of the following categories: Adult Learners \u2013 A wide variety of people in the community who wish to take undergraduate courses offered by Vanderbilt but are not pursuing a Vanderbilt degree. Auditors \u2013 Any interested person not affiliated with Vanderbilt or faculty/staff members who wish to audit a Vanderbilt course. Please note: Currently enrolled students who wish to audit a class should visit their school's Office of Academic Services. Faculty/Staff \u2013 Faculty/staff members and their spouses who are taking undergraduate classes for credit but are not pursuing a Vanderbilt degree.

Please refer to the Schedule of Classes for class offerings. Unless otherwise noted, classes are taught in person on the Vanderbilt campus. The Division of Unclassified Studies is a non-degree program. In determining if the Division of Unclassified Studies can help you meet your educational goals, it is important to note: Although there are no specific GPA or test score requirements for admission to DUS, an applicant must have a strong academic background that clearly demonstrates he or she is capable of succeeding in the Vanderbilt classroom, and meet any other criteria of the category for which they are applying. DUS students do not qualify for financial aid. All entering students in the Division of Unclassified Studies must be compliant with the State of Tennessee and Vanderbilt University student health requirements. Most students in the Division of Unclassified Studies must make their own arrangements for housing. Transient students may be eligible for housing during the summer term. Interested students should contact the Office of Housing and Residential Education",

International students seeking admission to the Division of Unclassified Studies must reside in the United States at the time of application, with an active visa status as issued by the U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services for admission consideration. Admission to the Division of Unclassified Studies does not guarantee admission to any Vanderbilt degree program, nor does it in any way influence such an admission decision. If a DUS student is later admitted into one of the degree-granting units of the university, credits earned while in DUS can be applied to the degree as long as: 1) the credits are applicable to the degree; 2) the credit was not used to meet high school graduation requirements; and 3) the credit represents no more than 25% of the hours required for the degree. The Office of the University Registrar is the point of contact for the application process, course enrollment, and course changes. Degree-seeking students at Vanderbilt have priority in course enrollments. DUS students may only enroll in classes that have available seats and for which they meet all course requisites.

The VA can take as long as 6-8 weeks to process certifications for VA educational benefits. Please note that student loan aid will be applied to outstanding charges on your student account. Refunds are only initiated when there is a refundable credit balance on your account which occurs after the VA payment posts. Students in modular programs may not have a refundable credit balance on their account until late in the semester which is why we recommend that students have a plan to cover the first 6-8 weeks of living expenses for each semester in which VA educational benefits are requested. Student Services and Student Health fees, as well as Vanderbilt\u2019s student health insurance fees, may be submitted to VA for certification",

Beginning with terms starting on or after December 17, 2021, Post 9-11 GI Bill\u00ae recipients who receive a monthly housing allowance (MHA) are required to verify enrollment at the end of each month to receive their MHA.
