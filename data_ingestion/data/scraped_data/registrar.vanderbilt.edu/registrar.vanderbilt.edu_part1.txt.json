    "text": "University Registrar Division of Unclassified Studies (DUS)  The Division of Unclassified Studies (DUS) provides an opportunity for non-degree seeking students to take undergraduate courses for credit at Vanderbilt. Students in DUS can take courses in a variety of Vanderbilt schools, provided space is available and all prerequisites have been met. Students who enroll in the Division of Unclassified Studies are classified into one of the following categories: Adult Learners – A wide variety of people in the community who wish to take undergraduate courses offered by Vanderbilt but are not pursuing a Vanderbilt degree. Auditors – Any interested person not affiliated with Vanderbilt or faculty/staff members who wish to audit a Vanderbilt course. Please note: Currently enrolled students who wish to audit a class should visit their school's Office of Academic Services. Faculty/Staff – Faculty/staff members and their spouses who are taking undergraduate classes for credit but are not pursuing a Vanderbilt degree. Pre-Freshmen – Junior and senior high school students who wish to supplement their secondary schooling by taking undergraduate-level college courses during the academic year or during the summer term. Transient Students – Degree-seeking students from other colleges and universities who wish to take undergraduate coursework at Vanderbilt to transfer back to their home institutions. Applications are due one week before the start of classes for each session",

Please note: Due to the timing of provisioning computing credentials, certifying immunization compliance, etc., it is highly recommended that applications be submitted no later than two weeks before the start of classes for each session. Please refer to the Schedule of Classes for class offerings. Unless otherwise noted, classes are taught in person on the Vanderbilt campus. The Division of Unclassified Studies is a non-degree program. In determining if the Division of Unclassified Studies can help you meet your educational goals, it is important to note: Although there are no specific GPA or test score requirements for admission to DUS, an applicant must have a strong academic background that clearly demonstrates he or she is capable of succeeding in the Vanderbilt classroom, and meet any other criteria of the category for which they are applying. DUS students do not qualify for financial aid. All entering students in the Division of Unclassified Studies must be compliant with the State of Tennessee and Vanderbilt University student health requirements. Most students in the Division of Unclassified Studies must make their own arrangements for housing. Transient students may be eligible for housing during the summer term. Interested students should contact the Office of Housing and Residential Education",

International students seeking admission to the Division of Unclassified Studies must reside in the United States at the time of application, with an active visa status as issued by the U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services for admission consideration. Admission to the Division of Unclassified Studies does not guarantee admission to any Vanderbilt degree program, nor does it in any way influence such an admission decision. If a DUS student is later admitted into one of the degree-granting units of the university, credits earned while in DUS can be applied to the degree as long as: 1) the credits are applicable to the degree; 2) the credit was not used to meet high school graduation requirements; and 3) the credit represents no more than 25% of the hours required for the degree. The Office of the University Registrar is the point of contact for the application process, course enrollment, and course changes. Degree-seeking students at Vanderbilt have priority in course enrollments. DUS students may only enroll in classes that have available seats and for which they meet all course requisites. DUS students may only attend classes for which they are registered. All tuition and fees must be paid in full by the published payment deadlines.

DUS students are required to resubmit an application and all accompanying documents, including updated transcripts, to the Office of the University Registrar for each semester that they wish to attend. DUS students may register for undergraduate courses through the Division of Unclassified Studies for a maximum of four semesters (including summer terms).

Under Review: Course is currently undergoing evaluation. Current undergraduate students must submit all courses for evaluation through the Transfer Credit Submission page. Newly admitted transfer students should not submit courses for evaluation--the External Education Unit will do so on their behalf. For coursework in the United States, courses must be offered through a regionally accredited college or university. International institutions must have country-specific accreditation. For lower-level (e.g., 1000- and 2000-level) courses, a course description is needed for evaluation for undergraduate students. For coursework taken at international institutions, course descriptions must be translated into English. For upper-level (e.g., 3000- and 4000-level and above) courses, detailed course syllabi are needed for evaluation for undergraduate students. For coursework taken at international institutions, syllabi must be translated into English. A minimum grade of C- is required. For students in the Graduate School, a minimum grade of B is required. No course that was taken on a Pass/Fail basis will be credited toward a Vanderbilt degree. Credit will not be awarded without an official copy of the transcript from the external institution",

Credit will not be awarded without an official copy of the transcript from the external institution. Official transcripts must be sent directly from the issuing institution to the Office of the University Registrar in order for credits to be posted to the student record. Credits are posted to the Vanderbilt record with a mark of T. Grades earned at external institutions are not posted to the Vanderbilt record, nor do those grades count toward the Vanderbilt grade point average. (For students in the Graduate School, grades earned on transferred credit do not affect the student’s Graduate School average unless such courses are to be counted as didactic hours. The grade earned for such courses will be reflected on the Vanderbilt transcript.) All courses listed on the external transcript for entering transfer students will be reviewed for credit at Vanderbilt. All courses that are approved for credit will be posted to the Vanderbilt transcript. Students who have submitted future course evaluations must have their official transcripts sent to Vanderbilt University by the following deadlines: For courses submitted for the fall semester: Official transcripts must be received no later than February 1. For courses submitted for the spring semester: Official transcripts must be received no later than July 1",

The College of Arts and Science and Peabody College usually do not award credit for work completed at other colleges and universities in the summer immediately preceding the student’s first semester at Vanderbilt. Students seeking such credit must obtain approval in advance from the appropriate dean. The approval should be uploaded along with the course information in the Transfer Credit Submission application. Semester work elsewhere is subject to additional review by the student's school, including approval for a leave of absence. Please contact your school's Office of Academic Services for information on how to begin the approval process. Once you have obtained your school's initial approval, submit course information along with the approval form to the Transfer Credit Submission application. Students in the School of Engineering are not permitted to transfer credits earned elsewhere while on administrative leave of absence without the specific approval from the Dean's Office. Students enrolled full time (i.e., carrying at least 12 credit hours) during a regular (fall or spring) semester are assumed to be engaged in full-time study at Vanderbilt. Such students are not permitted to take additional course work elsewhere, for transfer credit, during the semester. This includes online courses, as well as courses offered by nearby institutions",
