Our identity is composed of five key elements, each building on and supporting the others: story, purpose, beliefs, tone and ethos.

Cornelius Vanderbilt, the northern industrialist, and his southern wife, Frank Armstrong Vanderbilt, donated the largest charitable gift in American history at the time to support the vision of a Methodist bishop: to strengthen the ties between a divided country. At the time, there were no great universities in the South, so Vanderbilt was modeled after Ivy League schools in the North. But over the next 150 years, Vanderbilt grew from a regional university into a globally recognized institution. And as it evolved, it developed a culture all its own. The campus became home to ten distinct schools, intentionally designed to promote connection and interaction between students, faculty, and staff, alumni, and Nashville\u2014a city that\u2019s as much a part of Vanderbilt as Vanderbilt is of it",

The campus became home to ten distinct schools, intentionally designed to promote connection and interaction between students, faculty, and staff, alumni, and Nashville\u2014a city that\u2019s as much a part of Vanderbilt as Vanderbilt is of it. Blending grit, tenacity and community spirit with the relentless pursuit of human potential, Vanderbilt University has become one of the most admired and selective universities in the world. Our rise to the top in academics and athletics, from bioengineering to baseball, is due to one simple truth. At Vanderbilt, talented people find their own paths and team up to break new ground. This collaboration mindset infuses every aspect of university life\u2014our campus, classrooms, playing fields, stages, studios, and labs\u2014cutting across disciplinary boundaries with a unified sense of purpose. We are a community dedicated to the lifelong realization of our potential, and we carry this philosophy into the wider world. Because we know that when we put in the work together, we\u2019ll never stop growing and achieving. It\u2019s what we call \u201cradical collaboration.\u201d And it\u2019s what drives us Forward Ever. Purpose Beliefs 1. Belonging Once you're chosen, you belong. Vanderbilt is extremely selective intentionally. Only people with the highest potential will make the cut. Once you\u2019re here, you will be surrounded by the best and brightest, brought together for one simple purpose: to make each other better. Behaviors: Confident, never cutthroat.

It possesses a wide stance and an even rhythm, giving it a feeling of stature. As we use the new logotype and associated lockups, Vanderbilt will portray the perfect blend of classicism and modernism. The dimensional metallic V ensures prominence of our most iconic asset. If a V-forward lockup is desired, or you are designing a centered layout, or you need a more vertical vs. horizontal logo footprint, you may choose to employ the centered lockup. Special-Use Case: Pinstripe V Lockups In situations where printing the gradient of the beveled V within the primary lockup isn't possible (for example, on merchandise and certain signage), or when a small-scale use of the primary lockup doesn't render well, the preferred alternate is the pinstripe V lockup. The pinstripe adds a distinguishing detail, providing an effective alternative when the full gradient cannot be used. Special-Use Case: V Lockups This special-use V lockup is built for the rare instance when a particular printing\u00a0 process is unable to reproduce the primary mark or the pinstripe V effectively (for example, embroidery or another print process that doesn\u2019t allow for fine detail).

Oak laurel branches are showcased here as a symbol of strength. The north star guides our way, and the circular container shape alludes to the markings on a compass. For official use only. Contact brand communications if you would like to use the seal asset. Logotype Our custom-drawn logotype is our primary wordmark. When used by itself, it can brand less formal communications. V Icons Our V icon provides a clear way to tie your communications piece to the Vanderbilt brand when you have limited space, or an otherwise dense layout. Often, a V icon can be tucked into a corner to provide a subtle nod to the Vanderbilt brand. The dimensional V is the primary mark and should be used most often. It is used for academic school and department lockups, and to abbreviate the primary Vanderbilt lockups. The pinstripe V is reserved\u00a0for small-scale applications only and in situations when you are unable to use the dimensional V version.

Keep in mind that if an asset is used very small, the least detailed version available to you is recommended. Minimum width for our primary horizontal lockups with icon is 250 px, or 2 inches in print.

These guidelines are for general use and are intended to be a resource especially for those who communicate with external and internal audiences about the university. Students and faculty doing academic writing would likely be better served by consulting the style guides specific to their disciplines or more general grammar and style guides. The guidelines presented here are based primarily on The Associated Press Stylebook , which is a widely followed standard for questions of style among writers and publishers. The Vanderbilt editorial style guide, however, expands on its sources to create a reference specifically for Vanderbilt communicators, including Vanderbilt-specific terms and some exceptions to standard AP style. Please consider the guidelines presented here as the primary resource for questions of style in Vanderbilt communications, and always aim for consistency, clarity and accuracy. For answers to editorial style questions, consult this Vanderbilt editorial style guide first, then AP Stylebook, then a dictionary, preferably Webster\u2019s New World College Dictionary , fifth edition.

To complement the new Vanderbilt logotype, we rely on a mix of typefaces, which will be able to flex for Vanderbilt\u2019s communication needs. Serif and sans serif type pairings coexist harmoniously. Please note, the typefaces highlighted below are meant to be accessible by everyone. We prioritize Google fonts where possible (Libre Caslon, Antonio and Inter) because the forms more closely match our premium font selections. Where Google fonts are not possible, we use our universal alternative fonts (Times, Arial and Impact). Note to Professional Designers This typography guide is primarily for Vanderbilt faculty, staff and vendors. Please see the section at the end for the premium versions of these fonts, which require a license to use. For uses such as advertising, social media posts and story designs, high-impact print pieces like admissions brochures, or environmental applications such as signage, please be sure to use the premium fonts (JJannon for display serif, Staff XX Condensed for emphasis, and Theinhardt for display sans serif and body copy). Contact brand communications for further information. Serif Font for Headlines Primary: Libre Caslon This is the typeface we rely on for display sizes (such as page titles and large headlines).

These colors are unmistakably Vanderbilt. Gold is an ancient symbol of wealth and beauty \u2028with unique material properties. It's a conductor of heat and electricity, a reflector, a catalyst. It's malleable, ductile and never corrodes. Vanderbilt's association with gold is distinctive and should be protected through diligence about how it's deployed.

Do not use the primary lockups as your social media profile image. Voice, tone and more : Although social media often offers an opportunity to share more light-hearted content, it should all be filtered through a voice and tone that are consistent with the overall Vanderbilt messaging. When you post from a school or departmental account, you are representing the entire university; using correct spelling, grammar, punctuation and style are all important parts of conveying your message. Personal accounts : If you identify yourself as a Vanderbilt employee or student\u2013for example, through a bio or in comments\u2013you should include language in your account description that clarifies that you do not represent Vanderbilt University.

        "text": "Accessibility Overview Accessibility technically is about designing for users with disabilities. Philosophically, it isn\u2019t so much about designing for disability as it is about designing for everyone . (Accessibility compliance is also legally required .) Accessibility involves two key areas: How users with disabilities access electronic information How website owners enable websites and files to function with assistive devices used by individuals with disabilities Approximately 15 percent of the world\u2019s population\u00a0experience some form of disability. When designing for digital platforms, we must consider the potential accessibility issues users will have. Barriers include visual (e.g., low vision or color blindness) motor/mobility (e.g., wheelchair-user concerns) auditory (hearing difficulties) seizures (especially photosensitive epilepsy) and learning (e.g., dyslexia) We should also\u00a0design to maximize ease of use when users of any ability are in\u00a0stressful/mobile situations. By designing to reach all ability levels,\u00a0we can produce output virtually anyone can use and enjoy (or find helpful/calming), whatever the context. Designing for accessibility\u00a0helps all users. Section 508 Web Accessibility and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0) Section 508 and WCAG 2.0 are standards by which the web is made accessible to persons with disabilities",

Section 508 Web Accessibility and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0) Section 508 and WCAG 2.0 are standards by which the web is made accessible to persons with disabilities. Section 508 is mandated by the federal government as part of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. Although the law applies only to federal agencies, its guidelines should ideally be followed by all websites. Additionally, WCAG was implemented in 1999 by the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), which was formed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to bring accessibility considerations into development. These two sets of rules and guidelines are very similar, and this guide will assist you in making your website compliant. Vanderbilt strives to comply with the WCAG 2.0 standard. If you are interested in reading further on this topic, a list of sources and resources is provided at the end of this section. We can help you implement any of these requirements on your site. Color Use See the color guide for accessible color options. Practical Guidelines Your site must provide a text equivalent for every nontext element. This includes graphics, animations, scripts, buttons, sounds, audio and video. Vanderbilt\u2019s OmniUpdate Content Management System requires users to do this when uploading images or multimedia. If your site is in WordPress, you must do this manually",

Vanderbilt\u2019s OmniUpdate Content Management System requires users to do this when uploading images or multimedia. If your site is in WordPress, you must do this manually. We encourage users to think about the text they are using to describe the images they upload to make it as descriptive and informative as possible. The exception to this rule is if the nontext content is for decoration or visual formatting or is invisible. If you are having a video uploaded to YouTube or an audio file uploaded to SoundCloud, please supply captions for the content . If the video is a longer lecture, there are some automated programs that can capture the audio for you and convert it to text. (Services we recommend: ScriptoSphere ; SpeechMatics ) Other examples of text identification include notifying the user when the natural language for a document\u2019s text is changing (for example, if your website contains a paragraph in German, this should be noted). Have a link strategy. Describe the link before inserting it; e.g., \u201cRead more about the Provost's Office. \u201d Do not use \"click here\" as link text or \"here,\" because that is not descriptive of the content the user will encounter after they click. Offer visual cues (e.g., PDF and Word icons), underline links and highlight menu links on mouseover",

Offer visual cues (e.g., PDF and Word icons), underline links and highlight menu links on mouseover. If you have a slideshow on your website, and the images include text, the alt text must exactly match the text that is within the image itself. (Even better, do not use images that have text included as part of the image; use a live-text caption instead.) If you are working with tables, charts or graphs , you must either identify the row and column headers, or provide a link to the raw data that is used for chart creation. Ensure that your page is accessible to users with color blindness . One reason we carefully restrict color choices for headers, links, etc. is so that we can be sure the contrast between the foreground and background is sufficient for those with low vision or color blindness. (There are tools that will allow you to view your page as a color-blind user. Example: Experience Color Blindness >> ) Beware of animations that flash; the guidelines call for not using anything that flashes more than three times in any one-second period. (An example of what not to do: Don\u2019t Do This >> ) When organizing content, make sure that page titles, section headings and links are clear (e.g., if the link simply says \u201cclick here,\u201d it is unclear where the user will be going; if it reads \u201ccontact us,\u201d then the context is clear)",

Label fields and give descriptions to screen readers via tags. If you are using our supported form system, your forms are automatically accessible. If your page contains a lot of scripts or programmatic objects that will be unusable or not supported with certain accessibility programs, or your page is simply not accessible despite best efforts, consider having an alternative page that users can be directed to that is text only. (Please note, if you are using Vanderbilt templates, our scripts and tools are compatible. Otherwise, elements that may not be compatible can include sliders, embedded tickers/moving graphics/interactive games or forms.) When a webpage requires that an applet, plug-in or other application be present on the client system to interpret page content, the page must provide a link to a plug-in, applet or application. For example, if you provide links to PDFs, Word documents or Excel files, then you should also provide a link to the program that the user can download, or else provide an alternative means of accessing equivalent content.

PDFs and Other Digital Documents Vanderbilt recommends delivering your content on a webpage. Websites are more accessible (and more easily made accessible ) than digital documents such as PDFs, Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, Excel spreadsheets and digital flipbooks. If you must deliver your content through a PDF or other digital document, you must ensure it is accessible and compliant with Section 508 and WCAG 2.0 standards. To make a PDF accessible, we advise the following remediation steps: Use an accessible color palette. (See Color Use above. Any text or graphic elements containing text are restricted to the five colors shown and must be used on a white background. ) Use a remediation service for tagging and alternate text. Users can add the necessary tagging and alternate text to charts, images and graphics using Adobe Acrobat Pro. However, depending on the complexity of the document, it could be more efficient to use a professional remediation service, such as Common Look.
