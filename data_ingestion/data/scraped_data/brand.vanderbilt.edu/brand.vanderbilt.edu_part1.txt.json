Our identity is composed of five key elements, each building on and supporting the others: story, purpose, beliefs, tone and ethos. Ethos —our North Star Tone —our attitude when we communicate Beliefs— the core tenets that drive us Purpose— why we exist Story —the narrative that explains who we are Ethos —our North Star Tone —our attitude when we communicate Beliefs— the core tenets that drive us Purpose— why we exist Story —the narrative that explains who we are Our Story Vanderbilt University was founded in 1873, shortly after the end of the Civil War and the abolishment of slavery. Cornelius Vanderbilt, the northern industrialist, and his southern wife, Frank Armstrong Vanderbilt, donated the largest charitable gift in American history at the time to support the vision of a Methodist bishop: to strengthen the ties between a divided country. At the time, there were no great universities in the South, so Vanderbilt was modeled after Ivy League schools in the North. But over the next 150 years, Vanderbilt grew from a regional university into a globally recognized institution. And as it evolved, it developed a culture all its own. The campus became home to ten distinct schools, intentionally designed to promote connection and interaction between students, faculty, and staff, alumni, and Nashville—a city that’s as much a part of Vanderbilt as Vanderbilt is of it",

The campus became home to ten distinct schools, intentionally designed to promote connection and interaction between students, faculty, and staff, alumni, and Nashville—a city that’s as much a part of Vanderbilt as Vanderbilt is of it. Blending grit, tenacity and community spirit with the relentless pursuit of human potential, Vanderbilt University has become one of the most admired and selective universities in the world. Our rise to the top in academics and athletics, from bioengineering to baseball, is due to one simple truth. At Vanderbilt, talented people find their own paths and team up to break new ground. This collaboration mindset infuses every aspect of university life—our campus, classrooms, playing fields, stages, studios, and labs—cutting across disciplinary boundaries with a unified sense of purpose. We are a community dedicated to the lifelong realization of our potential, and we carry this philosophy into the wider world. Because we know that when we put in the work together, we’ll never stop growing and achieving. It’s what we call “radical collaboration.” And it’s what drives us Forward Ever. Purpose Beliefs 1. Belonging Once you're chosen, you belong. Vanderbilt is extremely selective intentionally. Only people with the highest potential will make the cut. Once you’re here, you will be surrounded by the best and brightest, brought together for one simple purpose: to make each other better. Behaviors: Confident, never cutthroat. When you join, you commit",

We believe personal purpose can only be found through relentless exploration and challenge. If it’s too comfortable, you’re not doing it right. Experience as much as you can. And once you discover your path, give it everything you have. Behaviors: Try, fail, learn, repeat. Embrace discomfort. Ready to change your mind. Put in the work. No shortcuts.

We believe that by challenging and supporting one another, high-functioning teams are able to accomplish far more than individuals. And only by rallying around a common purpose can we truly multiply our individual potential. Behaviors: Bands do more than soloists. Ditch the ego. See no boundaries. Pioneer together. Challenge directly. Respect the person. Redefine “possible.” 4. Growth We never stop growing and achieving. A permanent growth mindset is more important than any single achievement, however big. Vanderbilt believes that human potential is realized over a lifetime, in increments and leaps, and it expands as you grow",

Instead, it serves as an internal North Star to guide all of Vanderbilt’s actions and communication efforts.

We express it externally through the stories we share, the experiences we create, and the impact we have. Our Motto: “Crescere Aude” Crescere aude (Pronounced, kreh - sheh -ray ow-day ) is Latin for “dare to grow,” embodying the sentiment expressed in a section of Vanderbilt’s alma mater, “Forward ever be thy watchword …” Our Audiences Prospective and current undergraduates and their families Undergraduate students form the core of the Vanderbilt experience.

It possesses a wide stance and an even rhythm, giving it a feeling of stature. As we use the new logotype and associated lockups, Vanderbilt will portray the perfect blend of classicism and modernism. The dimensional metallic V ensures prominence of our most iconic asset. If a V-forward lockup is desired, or you are designing a centered layout, or you need a more vertical vs. horizontal logo footprint, you may choose to employ the centered lockup. Special-Use Case: Pinstripe V Lockups In situations where printing the gradient of the beveled V within the primary lockup isn't possible (for example, on merchandise and certain signage), or when a small-scale use of the primary lockup doesn't render well, the preferred alternate is the pinstripe V lockup. The pinstripe adds a distinguishing detail, providing an effective alternative when the full gradient cannot be used. Special-Use Case: V Lockups This special-use V lockup is built for the rare instance when a particular printing  process is unable to reproduce the primary mark or the pinstripe V effectively (for example, embroidery or another print process that doesn’t allow for fine detail). Contact brand communications if you need this version. Seal As an extension of our new identity, we have updated and modernized our drawing of the classic Vanderbilt seal",

Seal As an extension of our new identity, we have updated and modernized our drawing of the classic Vanderbilt seal.  Our custom-illustrated seal features our new motto (Crescere aude, \"dare to grow\"), year of founding, and reference to symbolism important to Vanderbilt’s distinguished history. Oak laurel branches are showcased here as a symbol of strength. The north star guides our way, and the circular container shape alludes to the markings on a compass. For official use only. Contact brand communications if you would like to use the seal asset. Logotype Our custom-drawn logotype is our primary wordmark. When used by itself, it can brand less formal communications. V Icons Our V icon provides a clear way to tie your communications piece to the Vanderbilt brand when you have limited space, or an otherwise dense layout. Often, a V icon can be tucked into a corner to provide a subtle nod to the Vanderbilt brand. The dimensional V is the primary mark and should be used most often. It is used for academic school and department lockups, and to abbreviate the primary Vanderbilt lockups. The pinstripe V is reserved for small-scale applications only and in situations when you are unable to use the dimensional V version.

This could be either the height of the V or height of the seal. Minimum Scale Please use the guidelines below when scaling down our lockups and icons. Keep in mind that if an asset is used very small, the least detailed version available to you is recommended. Minimum width for our primary horizontal lockups with icon is 250 px, or 2 inches in print.

These guidelines are for general use and are intended to be a resource especially for those who communicate with external and internal audiences about the university. Students and faculty doing academic writing would likely be better served by consulting the style guides specific to their disciplines or more general grammar and style guides. The guidelines presented here are based primarily on The Associated Press Stylebook , which is a widely followed standard for questions of style among writers and publishers. The Vanderbilt editorial style guide, however, expands on its sources to create a reference specifically for Vanderbilt communicators, including Vanderbilt-specific terms and some exceptions to standard AP style.

Do not use after forms of the verb “to be.” A colon may be used to set off a bulleted list or a list composed of long phrases. Example: Other topics covered during the fellowship included: distance learning, training teachers to use technology and integrating technology into classrooms in a meaningful way. EMPHASIS: The colon may be used to add emphasis. Example: He had only one hobby: eating. commas IN A SERIES: Use commas to separate elements in a series, but do not put a comma before the conjunction in most simple series: The flag is red, white and blue. She goes to school, plays league soccer and takes violin lessons. Put a comma before the concluding conjunction in a series if an integral element of the series requires a conjunction: I had orange juice, toast, and ham and eggs for breakfast.

IN COMPOUND SENTENCES: Use commas to separate independent clauses of a compound sentence: The group has ambitious plans for expanding the volunteer services they provide, and members are actively recruiting among their peers. Be careful to distinguish between a compound sentence (two or more independent clauses) and a compound predicate (two or more verbs having the same subject). Do not use a comma with a compound predicate. She attended three meetings that morning and in the afternoon went to class . (The subject of the sample sentence is she and the verbs are attended and went .)

John Smith Jr. and Pat White II are also on the committee. WITH LOCATIONS: Use commas to set off the elements in addresses and names of geographical places or political divisions.

Example: Wrong: not 20’s or 1960’s Right: ’20s, ’60s, 1960s      In most circumstances, when referring to Vanderbilt alumni and denoting their Vanderbilt degrees, list the earned degree abbreviation (no periods) after the name, followed immediately by an apostrophe (no space) and the last two digits of the degree year, all within commas. Example: Tiana Clark, MFA’17, is on the rise as one of poetry’s most exciting new voices. Lowercase degrees if spelled out: bachelor of arts, master of science, doctorate, doctor of philosophy .",

    "text": "Typography Typography: Classic Meets Modern Consistent use of typography is critical to bringing a brand to life. To complement the new Vanderbilt logotype, we rely on a mix of typefaces, which will be able to flex for Vanderbilt’s communication needs. Serif and sans serif type pairings coexist harmoniously. Please note, the typefaces highlighted below are meant to be accessible by everyone. We prioritize Google fonts where possible (Libre Caslon, Antonio and Inter) because the forms more closely match our premium font selections. Where Google fonts are not possible, we use our universal alternative fonts (Times, Arial and Impact). Note to Professional Designers This typography guide is primarily for Vanderbilt faculty, staff and vendors. Please see the section at the end for the premium versions of these fonts, which require a license to use. For uses such as advertising, social media posts and story designs, high-impact print pieces like admissions brochures, or environmental applications such as signage, please be sure to use the premium fonts (JJannon for display serif, Staff XX Condensed for emphasis, and Theinhardt for display sans serif and body copy). Contact brand communications for further information. Serif Font for Headlines Primary: Libre Caslon This is the typeface we rely on for display sizes (such as page titles and large headlines). Libre Caslon is a free display type family developed by Pablo Impallari",

These colors are unmistakably Vanderbilt. Gold is an ancient symbol of wealth and beauty  with unique material properties. It's a conductor of heat and electricity, a reflector, a catalyst. It's malleable, ductile and never corrodes. Vanderbilt's association with gold is distinctive and should be protected through diligence about how it's deployed.

Many new \"digital\" printers are capable of printing metallic gold. The fallback flat gold should only be used when a printer, such as an office color copier, can't accommodate metallic ink. Consult your vendor about using metallic inks. In digital contexts (for example, websites, presentations and video) we use a metallic gradient to mimic the reflectivity of gold. Our gradient is subtle, pure and bright. Accessibility Use of contrast and color is essential to accessibility and to ensuring that our design work is available to all audiences. Our core palette is high-contrast by nature. The color pairings shown below are Level AA accessible. WCAG AA requires a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text. To ensure compliance, please don't stray from these pairings. Secondary Colors: Neutrals While our primary palette deploys a high-contrast triad, these colors are supported by warm neutrals: cream, taupes and grays, with higher-saturation hues for impact. Our core colors will make up 90% of use, while 10% can be made up of secondary neutral accents",

When you post from a school or departmental account, you are representing the entire university; using correct spelling, grammar, punctuation and style are all important parts of conveying your message. Personal accounts : If you identify yourself as a Vanderbilt employee or student–for example, through a bio or in comments–you should include language in your account description that clarifies that you do not represent Vanderbilt University.

Philosophically, it isn’t so much about designing for disability as it is about designing for everyone . (Accessibility compliance is also legally required .) Accessibility involves two key areas: How users with disabilities access electronic information How website owners enable websites and files to function with assistive devices used by individuals with disabilities Approximately 15 percent of the world’s population experience some form of disability. When designing for digital platforms, we must consider the potential accessibility issues users will have. Barriers include visual (e.g., low vision or color blindness) motor/mobility (e.g., wheelchair-user concerns) auditory (hearing difficulties) seizures (especially photosensitive epilepsy) and learning (e.g., dyslexia) We should also design to maximize ease of use when users of any ability are in stressful/mobile situations. By designing to reach all ability levels, we can produce output virtually anyone can use and enjoy (or find helpful/calming), whatever the context. Designing for accessibility helps all users. Section 508 Web Accessibility and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0) Section 508 and WCAG 2.0 are standards by which the web is made accessible to persons with disabilities",

Section 508 Web Accessibility and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0) Section 508 and WCAG 2.0 are standards by which the web is made accessible to persons with disabilities. Section 508 is mandated by the federal government as part of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. Although the law applies only to federal agencies, its guidelines should ideally be followed by all websites. Additionally, WCAG was implemented in 1999 by the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), which was formed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to bring accessibility considerations into development. These two sets of rules and guidelines are very similar, and this guide will assist you in making your website compliant. Vanderbilt strives to comply with the WCAG 2.0 standard. If you are interested in reading further on this topic, a list of sources and resources is provided at the end of this section. We can help you implement any of these requirements on your site. Color Use See the color guide for accessible color options. Practical Guidelines Your site must provide a text equivalent for every nontext element. This includes graphics, animations, scripts, buttons, sounds, audio and video. Vanderbilt’s OmniUpdate Content Management System requires users to do this when uploading images or multimedia. If your site is in WordPress, you must do this manually",

Vanderbilt’s OmniUpdate Content Management System requires users to do this when uploading images or multimedia. If your site is in WordPress, you must do this manually. We encourage users to think about the text they are using to describe the images they upload to make it as descriptive and informative as possible. The exception to this rule is if the nontext content is for decoration or visual formatting or is invisible. If you are having a video uploaded to YouTube or an audio file uploaded to SoundCloud, please supply captions for the content . If the video is a longer lecture, there are some automated programs that can capture the audio for you and convert it to text. (Services we recommend: ScriptoSphere ; SpeechMatics ) Other examples of text identification include notifying the user when the natural language for a document’s text is changing (for example, if your website contains a paragraph in German, this should be noted). Have a link strategy. Describe the link before inserting it; e.g., “Read more about the Provost's Office. ” Do not use \"click here\" as link text or \"here,\" because that is not descriptive of the content the user will encounter after they click. Offer visual cues (e.g., PDF and Word icons), underline links and highlight menu links on mouseover",

Offer visual cues (e.g., PDF and Word icons), underline links and highlight menu links on mouseover. If you have a slideshow on your website, and the images include text, the alt text must exactly match the text that is within the image itself. (Even better, do not use images that have text included as part of the image; use a live-text caption instead.) If you are working with tables, charts or graphs , you must either identify the row and column headers, or provide a link to the raw data that is used for chart creation. Ensure that your page is accessible to users with color blindness . One reason we carefully restrict color choices for headers, links, etc. is so that we can be sure the contrast between the foreground and background is sufficient for those with low vision or color blindness. (There are tools that will allow you to view your page as a color-blind user. Example: Experience Color Blindness >> ) Beware of animations that flash; the guidelines call for not using anything that flashes more than three times in any one-second period. (An example of what not to do: Don’t Do This >> ) When organizing content, make sure that page titles, section headings and links are clear (e.g., if the link simply says “click here,” it is unclear where the user will be going; if it reads “contact us,” then the context is clear)",

Label fields and give descriptions to screen readers via tags. If you are using our supported form system, your forms are automatically accessible. If your page contains a lot of scripts or programmatic objects that will be unusable or not supported with certain accessibility programs, or your page is simply not accessible despite best efforts, consider having an alternative page that users can be directed to that is text only. (Please note, if you are using Vanderbilt templates, our scripts and tools are compatible. Otherwise, elements that may not be compatible can include sliders, embedded tickers/moving graphics/interactive games or forms.) When a webpage requires that an applet, plug-in or other application be present on the client system to interpret page content, the page must provide a link to a plug-in, applet or application. For example, if you provide links to PDFs, Word documents or Excel files, then you should also provide a link to the program that the user can download, or else provide an alternative means of accessing equivalent content. When posting images to social media , if the platform supports providing alt text, you should provide appropriate alt text for the images posted.

PDFs and Other Digital Documents Vanderbilt recommends delivering your content on a webpage. Websites are more accessible (and more easily made accessible ) than digital documents such as PDFs, Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, Excel spreadsheets and digital flipbooks. If you must deliver your content through a PDF or other digital document, you must ensure it is accessible and compliant with Section 508 and WCAG 2.0 standards. To make a PDF accessible, we advise the following remediation steps: Use an accessible color palette. (See Color Use above. Any text or graphic elements containing text are restricted to the five colors shown and must be used on a white background. ) Use a remediation service for tagging and alternate text. Users can add the necessary tagging and alternate text to charts, images and graphics using Adobe Acrobat Pro. However, depending on the complexity of the document, it could be more efficient to use a professional remediation service, such as Common Look.
