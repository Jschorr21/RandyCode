        "text": "Event Calendar Best Practices Calendar items are a great way to get your seminars, meetings, special presentations, readings, exhibits, surveys and fun events in front of your most interested audience. Bonus: The redesign of MyVU means that your calendar items are a lot more likely to get picked up for publication. BUT. They need to be written in a format that lends itself to that kind of highlight. Information basics: Calendar items should have the basic \u201cfive Ws and H\u201d (who, what, when, where, why and how) in a concise, straightforward format. If an event is virtual, type \u201cVirtual\u201d in the location field. Then include the registration/zoom/website link in the description field. It\u2019s also good to keep a standard \u201cboilerplate\u201d paragraph about your organization that you can paste onto the end of your current item\u2014people don\u2019t always know what you\u2019re about. It\u2019s likely this paragraph already exists on a website, in a brochure, on a flyer on the wall. Don\u2019t reinvent the wheel. Images: Images need to be less than 50KB, and in JPG, PNG or GIF format. Information in the image (like a flyer) cannot stand in for the information in the description field. Screen readers do not pick up text on images, so that information is not accessible to people with visual impairments or who use screen readers because they learn better by listening. The recommended approach is a standalone image",
