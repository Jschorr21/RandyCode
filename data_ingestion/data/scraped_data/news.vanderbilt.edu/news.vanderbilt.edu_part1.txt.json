Mindful eating: When we “stress-eat,” we eat quickly without noticing what or how much we’re eating. Mindful eating practices counteract stress by encouraging deep breaths, making thoughtful food choices, focusing attention on the meal and chewing food slowly and thoroughly. Regular exercise: Physical activity will help to lower blood pressure and stress hormone levels.

    "text": "Event Calendar Best Practices Calendar items are a great way to get your seminars, meetings, special presentations, readings, exhibits, surveys and fun events in front of your most interested audience. Bonus: The redesign of MyVU means that your calendar items are a lot more likely to get picked up for publication. BUT. They need to be written in a format that lends itself to that kind of highlight. Information basics: Calendar items should have the basic “five Ws and H” (who, what, when, where, why and how) in a concise, straightforward format. If an event is virtual, type “Virtual” in the location field. Then include the registration/zoom/website link in the description field. It’s also good to keep a standard “boilerplate” paragraph about your organization that you can paste onto the end of your current item—people don’t always know what you’re about. It’s likely this paragraph already exists on a website, in a brochure, on a flyer on the wall. Don’t reinvent the wheel. Images: Images need to be less than 50KB, and in JPG, PNG or GIF format. Information in the image (like a flyer) cannot stand in for the information in the description field. Screen readers do not pick up text on images, so that information is not accessible to people with visual impairments or who use screen readers because they learn better by listening. The recommended approach is a standalone image",
