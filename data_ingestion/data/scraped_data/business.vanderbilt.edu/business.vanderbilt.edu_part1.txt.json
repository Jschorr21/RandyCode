The Vanderbilt Master of Accountancy (MAcc) degree is a one-year, on-campus degree offering two distinct programs: MAcc Assurance and MAcc Valuation. These distinguished programs provide a fast track to launch a promising career with the world’s largest (and most prestigious) accounting and professional service firms. Both programs are designed for all majors and for those who are recent college graduates or have several years of experience.
