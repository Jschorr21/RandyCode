The Vanderbilt Master of Accountancy (MAcc) degree is a one-year, on-campus degree offering two distinct programs: MAcc Assurance and MAcc Valuation. These distinguished programs provide a fast track to launch a promising career with the world\u2019s largest (and most prestigious) accounting and professional service firms.
