Fleetwood, chair of the electrical engineering and computer science department, has received the 2009 IEEE Nuclear & Plasma Sciences Society (NPSS) Merit Award, which recognizes an individual who has made outstanding technical contributions to the fields of nuclear and plasma sciences.  Fleetwood accepted the award, which consists of $5,000, a plaque, and a certificate, at a recent IEEE/NPSS meeting in Quebec, Canada. IEEE originally represented electrical and electronics engineers, but it has expanded its scope and today is the world’s leading professional association for the advancement of technology. Fleetwood is a leader in understanding the effects of radiation on semiconductor materials and devices and he has made fundamental contributions to test methods for integrated circuits. He is the author of more than 335 publications on radiation effects in microelectronics, 10 of which have been recognized with outstanding paper awards. These papers have been cited more than 5,900 times. “Dan is a highly valued colleague who has served his department, the school, and Vanderbilt University with distinction.
