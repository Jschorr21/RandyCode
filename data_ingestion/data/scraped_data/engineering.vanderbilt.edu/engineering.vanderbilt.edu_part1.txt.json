Please contact Dean Cynthia Paschal via email (Cynthia.paschal@vanderbilt.edu) for permission if you would like to take more than 18 hours. GPA Information Q1 Where can I find my current GPA? A student’s GPA can be found on YES under the ‘Academic Record’ and ‘Academic Detail’. Q2 If I take classes at another school, are those grades included in my Vanderbilt GPA? No, the grades earned at another institution and transferred back to Vanderbilt will not count towards your Vanderbilt GPA. These courses will only earn credit hours towards the student’s degree.  This is also true for Vanderbilt Study Abroad programs, as well as for non-Vanderbilt affiliated study away. Q3 What is the required GPA to graduate? A 2.0 GPA minimum in three areas:  all major courses, all Engineering courses, and all courses taken cumulatively is required to graduate. If a student has met all other requirements but does not have the minimum GPA, he/she will not graduate. Grade Requirements Q1 What is considered a passing grade? A grade of D- or higher is considered a passing grade. A grade of ‘F’ is not passing. Leave of Absence Q1 What is a leave of absence?

Students can take either a medical leave or a personal leave. Medical leaves are usually recommended by a medical professional and require medical clearance prior to returning to your studies. Personal leaves require clearance by Engineering Administration, but do not usually require clearance to return to campus. Reasons for a leave may include but are not limited to: participation in a non-academic program, working to earn money, attending to a family crisis, or gaining a sense of direction. Please see the above section on 'Academic Standing' for additonal information on a required leave of absence. Q2 How do I apply for a leave of absence? Contact the Office of Academic Services to discuss dates, deadlines, and other options that might be appropriate.  Students will then be asked to complete a ‘Request for Leave of Absence’ form’. You may later request an extension to a third fall/spring semester if necessary. Q3 How do I return from a leave of absence? Returning from a personal leave does not require any special permissions assuming that you return during the semester that you anticipated returning when initiating your leave of absence.  Returning from medical leave requires medical clearance. You can learn how to receive that clearance here",

It is highly recommended that the student meets with a staff member in the Office of Academic Services.  Appointments can be made by calling the Office of Academic Services at (615) 343-8061. Students may also choose to meet with their faculty adviser. Q2 How do I view my midterm deficiency? The midterm deficiency letter is accessible via Your Enrollment System (YES). It can be located by navigating to ‘Academic Record’ then ‘Academic Detail’ under the Semester in which the deficiency letter was received. Q3 What resources are available to help me overcome academic struggles? Many Vanderbilt students find themselves challenged by their classes for the first time and discover they need to \"learn\" how to study. Vanderbilt offers a range of supportive services to help students through this transition, including STEM tutoring via the Penji application. The Center for Student Wellbeing (CSW) also provides individual appointments and group workshops on academic skills and strategies. The CSW provides learning and information processing training for students who often understand course material but have difficulty applying it on exams, as well as workshops on time and task management, stress management, and test preparation strategies",

It depends upon your classification, major, and the course you desire to take Pass/Fail From the Undergraduate Catalog: Pass/Fail Course Provision Students may elect to take a limited number of courses on a Pass/Fail basis. To enroll for a course on a Pass/Fail basis, students must have completed at least two semesters at Vanderbilt, must have achieved at least sophomore standing, and must not be on academic probation. In addition, the following regulations apply to students enrolled in the School of Engineering: 1.   No more than 9 hours graded P will be accepted toward the B.S. or B.E. degree, as designated by each program's curriculum. Pass/Fail Electives Options by Program Open Liberal Arts Core Technical BME X X CEE X X ChBE X CompE X CS X X X EE/ECE X ES X X ME X X X (non-ME) 2.   No more than two courses may be taken on a Pass/Fail basis in any one semester. 3.   A minimum of 12 hours must be taken on a graded basis in any semester that a Pass/Fail course is taken. A graduating senior who needs fewer than 12 hours to graduate may take courses on a Pass/Fail basis as long as he or she takes the number of hours needed to graduate on a graded basis. 4",

Students may change from Pass/Fail to graded status until the deadline to withdraw for the semester. The deadline is posted on the Academic Calendar found on the Registrar's website. Those electing the Pass/Fail option must meet all course requirements (e.g., reports, papers, examinations, attendance, etc.) and are graded in the normal way. Instructors are not informed of the names of students enrolled on a Pass/Fail basis. At the end of the semester, a regular grade is submitted for the student enrolled under the P/F option. Any grade of D- or above is converted in the Student Records System to a P, while an F will be recorded if a student enrolled under this option fails the course. The P grade is not counted in the grade point average nor used in the determination of honors. The grade of F earned under the Pass/Fail option is included in the calculation of the grade point average. Q2 How do I change a class from a letter grade to Pass/Fail?

Students need to maintain 12 hours per semester in order to avoid academic probation.  Part-time student status brings varying possible consequences and will result in academic probation for students of all classifications. Seniors in their final semester who have less than 12 hours remaining to graduate may be able to underload. Please contact the Office of Academic Services for more information Q3 What happens if I fall below full-time status? There are a few possible consequences to being a part-time student. Please see the list below: Academic probation Financial aid may be impacted Ineligibility for Greek rush, an officer in a student society, or representing the University in external affairs Ineligibility to earn Dean’s list honors Health insurance and car insurance policies may require full-time status May need to report a part-time status when applying to medical school or law school Immigration status may be in jeopardy Loans may need to be paid back earlier if a student is part-time Students planning to take a part-time schedule must contact the Office of Academic Services to sign paperwork authorizing them to take a reduced course load",

Please contact Dean Cynthia Paschal via email (Cynthia.paschal@vanderbilt.edu) for permission if you would like to take more than 18 hours. Q1 Where can I find my current GPA? A student’s GPA can be found on YES under the ‘Academic Record’ and ‘Academic Detail’. Q2 If I take classes at another school, are those grades included in my Vanderbilt GPA? No, the grades earned at another institution and transferred back to Vanderbilt will not count towards your Vanderbilt GPA. These courses will only earn credit hours towards the student’s degree.  This is also true for Vanderbilt Study Abroad programs, as well as for non-Vanderbilt affiliated study away. Q3 What is the required GPA to graduate? A 2.0 GPA minimum in three areas:  all major courses, all Engineering courses, and all courses taken cumulatively is required to graduate. If a student has met all other requirements but does not have the minimum GPA, he/she will not graduate. Q1 What is considered a passing grade? A grade of D- or higher is considered a passing grade. A grade of ‘F’ is not passing. Q1 What is a leave of absence? A leave of absence allows students to interrupt their studies for one or two fall/spring semesters. Students can take either a medical leave or a personal leave",

Students can take either a medical leave or a personal leave. Medical leaves are usually recommended by a medical professional and require medical clearance prior to returning to your studies. Personal leaves require clearance by Engineering Administration, but do not usually require clearance to return to campus. Reasons for a leave may include but are not limited to: participation in a non-academic program, working to earn money, attending to a family crisis, or gaining a sense of direction. Please see the above section on 'Academic Standing' for additonal information on a required leave of absence. Q2 How do I apply for a leave of absence? Contact the Office of Academic Services to discuss dates, deadlines, and other options that might be appropriate.  Students will then be asked to complete a ‘Request for Leave of Absence’ form’. You may later request an extension to a third fall/spring semester if necessary. Q3 How do I return from a leave of absence? Returning from a personal leave does not require any special permissions assuming that you return during the semester that you anticipated returning when initiating your leave of absence.  Returning from medical leave requires medical clearance.

Many students find options for math electives, technical electives, liberal arts core or open electives to be the easiest to transfer back to Vanderbilt. However, students can take a number of different courses if equivalencies exist for the course requirements. In YES, the programs and course equivalencies can be found under the Study Abroad tab. Transfer Credit Q1 Can the courses I took elsewhere count towards my degree at Vanderbilt? Possibly, but the courses would need to be evaluated to see if they are the equivalent to the course at Vanderbilt. It is the student’s responsibility to provide all information needed for an assessment of the program for which transfer credit is requested. During compressed time periods such as the break between fall and spring terms or the Maymester term, no more than one course (up to four credit hours) may be taken for transfer credit in any one such period. Work transferred to Vanderbilt from another institution will not carry with it a grade point average. No course in which a grade below C- was received will be credited toward a degree offered by the School of Engineering. School of Engineering students cannot take a course that was failed at Vanderbilt for transfer credit. Transfer students must complete at least 60 hours of work at Vanderbilt. Two of the semesters must be the senior year",

Q4 Can I take a class or classes at a different institution in the same semester that I am enrolled in courses at Vanderbilt? No, concurrent enrollment at an external institution during a semester in which you are enrolled at Vanderbilt is not allowed. Undergraduate Research Q1 When can I start doing research? How do I get started? For most students, research is a way to explore areas of special interest in a particular discipline of engineering. By the time students become juniors, they have begun to choose some specialization through their coursework and we find this is a great time to begin to engage in research. We have also found that research experience as an undergraduate makes students extremely competitive for graduate school, graduate fellowships and prestigious scholarships.

Q2 How do I get enrolled in undergraduate research or individual study? Research/individual study requires completion of a request in YES, which there is a YES User Guide on how to submit a request Individual Study . Once the request is submitted and approved by the relevant departments students will be enrolled. Q1 What is a catalog year? A student’s catalog year refers to the academic year the student was first admitted to Vanderbilt. Q2 How do I know what catalog year I am on? The catalog year is important because the student is expected to follow the curriculum requirements that were in effect that academic year. For example, if a student was admitted in Fall 2022 their catalog year would be 2022-2023. Q3 Can I change my catalog year? Students can choose to follow any catalog year during the years they are a student at Vanderbilt. Students inquiring about a catalog year change should contact the Office of Academic Services. Q1 How do I change my major? The Major/Minor Declaration/Change workflow can be found by clicking on the link. The above workflow is to change your primary major within your home school or to add/drop a second major or minor inside or outside your home school.

Students in the School of Engineering cannot change their expected graduation term to an earlier semester unless they are planning to graduate early. Students planning to graduate in three years may request to change their expected graduation term (EGT) after the completion o ftheir fourth regular semester in residence; those planning to graduate one semester early may request to change their EGT after the completion of their fifth regular semester. Such requests much include a semester-by-semester plan showing how they will meet graduation requirements by the conclusion of their new expected graduation term. The plan must meet all prerequisite streams and be feasible based on course schedules available at the time of plan creation. The request also must include the approval/ endorsement of the Director of Undergraduate Studies in their major. Q1 What is the degree audit and how does it work? The degree audit is an academic advising document that maps a student’s degree requirements against their academic transcript. Q2 Why do I need to look at my degree audit? The purpose of the audit is to provide information to assist in academic planning and appropriate course scheduling. It is important for students to consistently view the audit by refreshing it to ensure they are on track with their requirements. It is also the student’s responsibility to seek out a correction if anything is incorrect on the audit",

Q3 Can I choose a different major to view in my degree audit? Yes, the “What If” degree audit is a tool to show students what their audit would look like if they pursued a different major(s) or minor(s). The “ What If ” audit will default to the settings used most recently, however these can be updated. Q1 What is a focus area? Focus areas provide guidance to students wishing to concentrate on a specialized topic within engineering. Focus areas are typically nine credit hours, and qualifying courses are listed in the catalog. Students can declare a maximum of three focus areas; however, a qualifying course cannot be applied to more than one focus area. Students interested in declaring a focus area must do so before the start of their final semester at Vanderbilt. Successful completion of a declared focus area will be designated on a student’s transcript upon graduation. Q2 What focus areas are available? We have the following focus areas available: Human Computer Interaction, Microelectronics, Nanotechnology, Strategic and Technical Consulting, Engineering Communications, Technology Entrepreneurship & Product Development",

Q1 What minors are offered in the School of Engineering? A declared minor consists of at least five courses of at least 3 credit hours each within a recognized area of knowledge. A minor offers students more than a casual introduction to an area, but less than a major. A minor is not a degree requirement, but students may elect to complete one or more. Courses applying to the minor may not be taken on a Pass/Fail basis. A minor for which all designated courses are completed with a grade point average of at least 2.0 will be entered on the transcript at the time of graduation. When a minor is offered in a discipline that offers a major, only those courses that count toward the major may be counted toward the minor. Students should refer to the appropriate sections of the undergraduate catalog for specific requirements. Currently, minors are offered in computer science, data science, digital fabrication, electrical & computer engineering, energy and environmental systems, engineering management, environmental engineering, materials science and engineering, nanoscience and nanotechnology, and scientific computing.

Students should declare their intention to pursue minors by completing the ' Change of Major ' form. Departments and programs assign advisers to students who declare minors in their areas. Students are responsible for knowing and satisfying all requirements for the minors they intend to complete. Q1 What is an open elective? Any course offered for credit at Vanderbilt University except Math 1005, 1010, 1011, and 1100 or Physics 1010,1010L, 2051, 2052, 2053 and 2054. Q2 Will my minor or double-major coursework count as open electives? It depends, but many of the classes likely can count as open electives. If your minor or double-major coursework is classified as a Liberal Arts Core it will fulfill this area and will not go towards your open electives unless the Liberal Arts Core is already fulfilled. Similarly, if the minor or double-major coursework overlaps with your major degree requirements it will count in the appropriate category instead of open electives as well. Q1 What double majors are offered in the School of Engineering? Certain double majors involving two programs within the School of Engineering have been approved by the faculty. The approved double majors are biomedical engineering/electrical and computer engineering, and biomedical engineering/chemical engineering",

Q4  Why am I getting a requisite error when I meet the co-requisite and pre-requisite requirements? For classes that have co-requisite labs, discussions, or modules (for instance, ES 1401,1402, and 1403), you MUST have a seat (not a spot on the waitlist) in each component to get a spot in the class.  That is, if there is an available seat in the lecture component of course, but there is not an available seat in your preferred lab component, the enrollment transaction will not work for either component. You should choose a different lab (with available seats) and then use the drop if enrolled . Q5  Why do a get a class capacity error or placed on the waitlist when there are seats available in a course? This could be for one of two reasons: The seats that remain available have been reserved for specific populations of students.  For example, the Math department typically reserves a portion of all Fall calculus courses (1300, 1301, and 2300) for incoming students.  Other departments reserve a portion of seats for student within their major or minor groups",

The course in which you are attempting to enroll is combined with a graduate class and the combined capacity for both courses has been met.  When this happens, it can appear that there are seats available that are in fact filled by graduate students in the affiliated listing. Q6 Does Vanderbilt offer summer engineering classes? Some Engineering courses are typically offered during the summer semesters, though offerings are limited. Foundational courses in mathematics, physics and chemistry, as well as courses in the liberal arts fields, are offered. Waitlisting Q1 Can I get a seat in a class that is full? You may choose to place yourself on the waitlist for most classes (this will not happen automatically). The waitlist is an optional function that allows students to sign-up for a course that is closed. Students who are waitlisted for a course are not registered but are waiting to register for the course. Q2 Why do some classes have no waitlist?

We are training the next generation of researchers to tackle scientific problems at the intersection of biology and mechanics. About Mechanobiology is a cross-disciplinary field at the interface of biology, physics and engineering that seeks to provide fundamental insight into how mechanical forces drive cellular processes. The human body is much more than just a set of genes and proteins, and we now know that disease can be caused and promoted by factors beyond genetics. Almost every organ, tissue, and cell are exposed to mechanical forces, and these forces are integral to healthy cellular function. Elucidating the role of mechanical forces at molecular, cellular and tissue levels offers the potential to impact human health in news ways. Our understanding of mechanotransduction (how cells translate physical forces into chemical signals) is still developing and has been proven to be critical in numerous physiological systems and disease states including cancer, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease and fibrosis",

    "text": ". Research in mechanobiology aims to uncover how cells respond to physical forces and how these forces affect tissue formation, degeneration and regeneration in both basic physiology and disease. Furthermore, mechanomedicine offers the ability to target disease based on the manipulation of the mechanical properties of molecules, cells and tissues, taking medicine into a new frontier. Mechanobiology also impacts biotechnologies from catalysis to biomanufacturing, bioconversion and sustainable energy production.

The 2023 class of inductees into the Academy and the Circle of Friends are “influencers” with tremendous impact, said Dean Fauchet. “They have broken barriers, built outstanding careers, and guided and shaped engineering education while enriching the lives of those in their communities and beyond.” To read more about the 2023 inductees, please click the link here. Members of the Academy of Distinguished Alumni Opportunity Vanderbilt Vanderbilt has boldly replaced all need-based undergraduate student loans with scholarship and grant assistance. This initiative, called Opportunity Vanderbilt , is helping to ensure that young people of every background can attend Vanderbilt, creating a dynamic learning community that benefits every student. About 62 percent of Vanderbilt undergraduates received financial aid last year. To secure the future of this program, we need to shift the costs of it from the operating budget to a larger endowment. If you’d like to know more about endowed scholarships, please contact the School of Engineering Development Office by email or by calling (615) 322-4934.

We seek outstanding candidates with principal efforts toward experiments and/or simulations in the areas of sustainability, electrochemical engineering, green manufacturing, biomolecular engineering (bioprocessing, biosystems engineering), health (immunology, neuroscience), and materials to complement existing Departmental, School, and University strengths. We seek candidates who can synergistically leverage our strong interdisciplinary environment to establish a leading research program that applies engineering approaches to solve key societal problems. This search will align with University initiatives that are departmental strengths. Research in environmental separations (clean water, CO2 removal, H2 sourcing) and in sustainable energy generation/storage (solar, biomass, batteries) that provide climate solutions are areas ripe for developing strong cross-department collaborations. Bioengineering is a vibrant area in our department, and existing programs in immunology, omics, metabolism, and neuroscience provide a supportive environment for fundamental and translational research",
