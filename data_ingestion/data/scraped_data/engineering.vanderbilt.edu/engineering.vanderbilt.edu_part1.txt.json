Students may change from Pass/Fail to graded status until the deadline to withdraw for the semester. The deadline is posted on the Academic Calendar found on the Registrar's website. Those electing the Pass/Fail option must meet all course requirements (e.g., reports, papers, examinations, attendance, etc.) and are graded in the normal way. Instructors are not informed of the names of students enrolled on a Pass/Fail basis. At the end of the semester, a regular grade is submitted for the student enrolled under the P/F option. Any grade of D- or above is converted in the Student Records System to a P, while an F will be recorded if a student enrolled under this option fails the course. The P grade is not counted in the grade point average nor used in the determination of honors. The grade of F earned under the Pass/Fail option is included in the calculation of the grade point average. Q2 How do I change a class from a letter grade to Pass/Fail?

Many students find options for math electives, technical electives, liberal arts core or open electives to be the easiest to transfer back to Vanderbilt. However, students can take a number of different courses if equivalencies exist for the course requirements. In YES, the programs and course equivalencies can be found under the Study Abroad tab. Transfer Credit Q1 Can the courses I took elsewhere count towards my degree at Vanderbilt? Possibly, but the courses would need to be evaluated to see if they are the equivalent to the course at Vanderbilt. It is the student\u2019s responsibility to provide all information\u00a0needed for an assessment of the program for which transfer credit is requested. During compressed time periods such as the break between fall and spring terms or the Maymester term, no more than one course (up to four credit hours) may be taken for transfer credit in any one such period. Work transferred to Vanderbilt from another institution will not carry with it a grade point average. No course in which a grade below C- was received will be credited toward a degree offered by the School of Engineering. School of Engineering students cannot take a course that was failed at Vanderbilt for transfer credit. Transfer students must complete at least 60 hours of work at Vanderbilt. Two of the semesters must be the senior year",

The School of Engineering does not have a limit to the number of AP or IB credits you can transfer to Vanderbilt. However, we do not accept AP credit for Statistics and Physics. Some students may qualify for advanced placement or advanced credit in mathematics, science, the humanities and social sciences, or computer science. If advanced credit is awarded, it will not affect the student's Vanderbilt grade point average. Entering engineering students will be placed in the appropriate level mathematics course by the director of undergraduate mathematics program. Students offering one full year or more of high school credit in analytic geometry and calculus may qualify for advance placement in a regular sequence by scoring well on the Advance Placement Examination. Q3 If I plan to take classes over the summer how do I know if it will transfer to Vanderbilt? The transfer credit course review at Vanderbilt is conducted through the External Education Unit.

Students need to attach a syllabus if the course they are taking does not have an equivalency listed in the transfer credit search tool. Q4 Can I take a class or classes at a different institution in the same semester that I am enrolled in courses at Vanderbilt? No, concurrent enrollment at an external institution during a semester in which you are enrolled at Vanderbilt is not allowed. Undergraduate Research Q1 When can I start doing research? How do I get started? For most students, research is a way to explore areas of special interest in a particular discipline of engineering. By the time students become juniors, they have begun to choose some specialization through their coursework and we find this is a great time to begin to engage in research. We have also found that research experience as an undergraduate makes students extremely competitive for graduate school, graduate fellowships and prestigious scholarships. To learn about the guidelines for seeking research opportunities, please visit the undergraduate research\u00a0website",

Research/individual study requires completion of a request in YES, which there is a YES User Guide on how to submit a request Individual Study . Once the request is submitted and approved by the relevant departments students will be enrolled. Q1 What is a catalog year? A student\u2019s catalog year refers to the academic year the student was first admitted to Vanderbilt. Q2 How do I know what catalog year I am on? The catalog year is important because the student is expected to follow the curriculum requirements that were in effect that academic year. For example, if a student was admitted in Fall 2022 their catalog year would be 2022-2023. Q3 Can I change my catalog year? Students can choose to follow any catalog year during the years they are a student at Vanderbilt. Students inquiring about a catalog year change should contact the Office of Academic Services. Q1 How do I change my major? The Major/Minor Declaration/Change workflow can be found by clicking on the link. The above workflow is to change your primary major within your home school or to add/drop a second major or minor inside or outside your home school.

Such requests much include a semester-by-semester plan showing how they will meet graduation requirements by the conclusion of their new expected graduation term. The plan must meet all prerequisite streams and be feasible based on course schedules available at the time of plan creation. The request also must include the approval/ endorsement of the Director of Undergraduate Studies in their major. Q1 What is the degree audit and how does it work? The degree audit is an academic advising document that maps a student\u2019s degree requirements against their academic transcript. Q2 Why do I need to look at my degree audit? The purpose of the audit is to provide information to assist in academic planning and appropriate course scheduling. It is important for students to consistently view the audit by refreshing it to ensure they are on track with their requirements. It is also the student\u2019s responsibility to seek out a correction if anything is incorrect on the audit",

Students who wish to study abroad will need to work with their faculty adviser, the Office of Academic Services and GEO to ensure that the plan will work correctly for the expected graduation term. Q2 How do I know what courses to take abroad? Careful planning is the key for knowing what courses should be taken abroad. Many students find options for math electives, technical electives, liberal arts core or open electives to be the easiest to transfer back to Vanderbilt",

However, students can take a number of different courses if equivalencies exist for the course requirements. In YES, the programs and course equivalencies can be found under the Study Abroad tab. Q1 Can the courses I took elsewhere count towards my degree at Vanderbilt? Possibly, but the courses would need to be evaluated to see if they are the equivalent to the course at Vanderbilt. It is the student\u2019s responsibility to provide all information\u00a0needed for an assessment of the program for which transfer credit is requested. During compressed time periods such as the break between fall and spring terms or the Maymester term, no more than one course (up to four credit hours) may be taken for transfer credit in any one such period. Work transferred to Vanderbilt from another institution will not carry with it a grade point average. No course in which a grade below C- was received will be credited toward a degree offered by the School of Engineering. School of Engineering students cannot take a course that was failed at Vanderbilt for transfer credit. Transfer students must complete at least 60 hours of work at Vanderbilt. Two of the semesters must be the senior year. Please refer to the Transfer Students link",

Q2 Is there a limit to the number of AP or IB credits I can transfer? The School of Engineering does not have a limit to the number of AP or IB credits you can transfer to Vanderbilt. However, we do not accept AP credit for Statistics and Physics. Some students may qualify for advanced placement or advanced credit in mathematics, science, the humanities and social sciences, or computer science. If advanced credit is awarded, it will not affect the student's Vanderbilt grade point average. Entering engineering students will be placed in the appropriate level mathematics course by the director of undergraduate mathematics program. Students offering one full year or more of high school credit in analytic geometry and calculus may qualify for advance placement in a regular sequence by scoring well on the Advance Placement Examination. Q3 If I plan to take classes over the summer how do I know if it will transfer to Vanderbilt? The transfer credit course review at Vanderbilt is conducted through the External Education Unit. They have each individual department review the syllabi to determine if they can grant transfer credit. Students may use the transfer credit search tool to see if a course has already been evaluated for transfer credit",

Students need to attach a syllabus if the course they are taking does not have an equivalency listed in the transfer credit search tool. Q4 Can I take a class or classes at a different institution in the same semester that I am enrolled in courses at Vanderbilt? No, concurrent enrollment at an external institution during a semester in which you are enrolled at Vanderbilt is not allowed. Q1 When can I start doing research? How do I get started? For most students, research is a way to explore areas of special interest in a particular discipline of engineering. By the time students become juniors, they have begun to choose some specialization through their coursework and we find this is a great time to begin to engage in research. We have also found that research experience as an undergraduate makes students extremely competitive for graduate school, graduate fellowships and prestigious scholarships.

Q4\u00a0 Why am I getting a requisite error when I meet the co-requisite and pre-requisite requirements? For classes that have co-requisite labs, discussions, or modules (for instance, ES 1401,1402, and 1403), you MUST have a seat (not a spot on the waitlist) in each component to get a spot in the class.\u00a0 That is, if there is an available seat in the lecture component of course, but there is not an available seat in your preferred lab component, the enrollment transaction will not work for either component. You should choose a different lab (with available seats) and then use the drop if enrolled . Q5\u00a0 Why do a get a class capacity error or placed on the waitlist when there are seats available in a course? This could be for one of two reasons: The seats that remain available have been reserved for specific populations of students.\u00a0 For example, the Math department typically reserves a portion of all Fall calculus courses (1300, 1301, and 2300) for incoming students.\u00a0 Other departments reserve a portion of seats for student within their major or minor groups",

The course in which you are attempting to enroll is combined with a graduate class and the combined capacity for both courses has been met.\u00a0 When this happens, it can appear that there are seats available that are in fact filled by graduate students in the affiliated listing. Q6 Does Vanderbilt offer summer engineering classes? Some Engineering courses are typically offered during the summer semesters, though offerings are limited. Foundational courses in mathematics, physics and chemistry, as well as courses in the liberal arts fields, are offered. Waitlisting Q1 Can I get a seat in a class that is full? You may choose to place yourself on the waitlist for most classes (this will not happen automatically). The waitlist is an optional function that allows students to sign-up for a course that is closed. Students who are waitlisted for a course are not registered but are waiting to register for the course. Q2 Why do some classes have no waitlist? Waitlist options are determined by Vanderbilt departments. If there is no wait list for a class you will need to check the class periodically for open seats. Q1 How do I add my classes? Students may enroll in courses in YES (Your Enrollment System). An advising hold will be placed each semester before registration, so students must make sure to contact their faculty adviser and schedule a meeting prior to enrollment so that they are clear to add courses",

        "text": ". An advising hold will be placed each semester before registration, so students must make sure to contact their faculty adviser and schedule a meeting prior to enrollment so that they are clear to add courses. Once a student is logged into YES, the registration is located under the \u2018Applications\u2019 tab as \u2018Student Registration\u2019. In this tab students can view their enrollment dates, semester enrollment, courses in their registration cart and search for courses to add. The \u2018Search Classes\u2019 function is defaulted to a basic search but the advanced search is located to the right of the search window. Once a student searches for a course, a plus sign will appear next to the course. The student may click on the plus sign to add the course to their registration cart. Students may add classes through YES through the first week of class; after the first week of class students need to use a \u201cChange of Course Request\u201d form and receive Instructor permission to add a course. We recommend that students check the Office of the University Registrar\u2019s website for the academic dates/deadlines calendar . Q2 I'm an incoming first-year student. How do I register for my first semester classes? The Office of Academic Services will communicate with you prior to your registration (multiple times) to explain these processes.\u00a0 In short, you will login to YES to see your registration appointment windows, and to view YES tutorials for complete information on using YES",

Depending on your major, you will need between 120-127 hours to graduate; plan to average 15-17 hours per semester.\u00a0 You will be advised on what classes to take sometime in mid-May. Q3 Can I enroll in two classes that have a time conflict? As stated in the Undergraduate Catalog, students are expected to attend all scheduled meetings of each class in which they are enrolled. As such, students cannot enroll in courses that have a time conflict. Exceptions for cases involving two courses required for the major that have a small overlap in time may be considered; contact the Office of Academic Services to discuss. Q1 How do I drop a class? Through the first 8 days of classes, students may drop classes through YES (Your Enrollment System). Once a student is logged into YES, the registration is located under the \u2018Applications\u2019 tab as \u2018Student Registration\u2019. In this tab students can view their enrollment dates, semester enrollment, courses in their registration cart and search for courses. Q2 I plan to drop a class and as a result I will drop below 12 hours. Am I still considered a full time student? A schedule which is less than 12 hours is considered to be part-time. Students who plan on taking a part-time schedule should contact the Office of Academic Services for additional information. Q1 I have a hold on my record. What do I do? In the instance that you have a hold, you will need to check what kind of hold you have",

Contact the appropriate office for that specific hold (for example, student accounts or financial aid for a financial hold). If you need additional help, contact the Office of Academic Services. Q2\u00a0 What is an Academic Adviser hold? Students are required to meet with their academic adviser prior to registering for classes each term. Academic Advising holds will be removed by the faculty adviser after that meeting has taken place. Q1 How do I find a list of prerequisites or co-requisites for classes? The prerequisites and co-requisites for a course will be listed in the course description for the course in the Undergraduate Catalog . The Office of Academic Services has curriculum sheets with the prerequisites and corequisites by major degree requirements. Students are welcome to contact the Office of Academic Services for a digital copy. Q2 Are prerequisites and co-requisites strictly enforced? Yes. The prerequisites and co-requisites are in place to make sure that students have the background information for the class they are going to take. Students should plan each semester carefully by consulting whether or not they will be meeting all prerequisites and co-requisites listed. Students lacking prerequisites or co-requisites can be admitted to a course by the course\u2019s instructor and using a ' Request for Course Requisite Variance '\u00a0form",

Q1 What are important registration dates to know? All important academic dates/deadlines for the semester can be found on the Office of the University Registrar website. Some common dates to remember are the first and last day of classes, add/drop deadlines, registration windows, the deadline to change a course to pass/fail or to graded, etc. Q2 How much time should I allow between my classes? Care should be taken during the schedule building process to ensure that you have enough time to get from one building to the location of a subsequent class. \u00a0If you have a course in either the Engineering and Science Building (ESB) or Olin Hall, it could be difficult to reach classes on the Peabody campus, in Wilson Hall, or on the Blair School of Music campus.\u00a0 If you have a course in either Featheringill Hall or Stevenson Center 5, it could be difficult to reach classes on the Peabody campus or on the Blair School of Music campus. Q3 I get an Error message when trying to enroll ---does it mean YES is not working? No, it means that your action created an error. You should read the message carefully to see why there is an error. You might not meet the prerequisites for the class, or perhaps the class requires permission of the instructor. Check the message carefully",

Check the message carefully. If you can't figure it out, contact the YES help desk (\"Help\" on the upper right corner of the page) before you panic! Q4\u00a0 Why am I getting a requisite error when I meet the co-requisite and pre-requisite requirements? For classes that have co-requisite labs, discussions, or modules (for instance, ES 1401,1402, and 1403), you MUST have a seat (not a spot on the waitlist) in each component to get a spot in the class.\u00a0 That is, if there is an available seat in the lecture component of course, but there is not an available seat in your preferred lab component, the enrollment transaction will not work for either component. You should choose a different lab (with available seats) and then use the drop if enrolled . Q5\u00a0 Why do a get a class capacity error or placed on the waitlist when there are seats available in a course? This could be for one of two reasons: The seats that remain available have been reserved for specific populations of students.\u00a0 For example, the Math department typically reserves a portion of all Fall calculus courses (1300, 1301, and 2300) for incoming students.\u00a0 Other departments reserve a portion of seats for student within their major or minor groups",

The course in which you are attempting to enroll is combined with a graduate class and the combined capacity for both courses has been met.\u00a0 When this happens, it can appear that there are seats available that are in fact filled by graduate students in the affiliated listing. Q6 Does Vanderbilt offer summer engineering classes? Some Engineering courses are typically offered during the summer semesters, though offerings are limited. Foundational courses in mathematics, physics and chemistry, as well as courses in the liberal arts fields, are offered. Q1 Can I get a seat in a class that is full? You may choose to place yourself on the waitlist for most classes (this will not happen automatically). The waitlist is an optional function that allows students to sign-up for a course that is closed. Students who are waitlisted for a course are not registered but are waiting to register for the course. Q2 Why do some classes have no waitlist? Waitlist options are determined by Vanderbilt departments. If there is no wait list for a class you will need to check the class periodically for open seats.

We are training the next generation of researchers to tackle scientific problems at the intersection of biology\u00a0and mechanics. About Mechanobiology is a cross-disciplinary field at the interface of biology, physics and engineering that seeks to provide fundamental insight into how mechanical forces drive cellular processes. The human body is much more than just a set of genes and proteins, and we now know that disease can be caused and promoted by factors beyond genetics. Almost every organ, tissue, and cell are exposed to mechanical forces, and these forces are integral to healthy cellular function. Elucidating the role of mechanical forces at molecular, cellular and tissue levels offers the potential to impact human health in news ways. Our understanding of mechanotransduction (how cells translate physical forces into chemical signals) is still developing and has been proven to be critical in numerous physiological systems and disease states including cancer, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease and fibrosis",
