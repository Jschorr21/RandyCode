A student’s GPA can be found on YES under the ‘Academic Record’ and ‘Academic Detail’. Q2 If I take classes at another school, are those grades included in my Vanderbilt GPA? No, the grades earned at another institution and transferred back to Vanderbilt will not count towards your Vanderbilt GPA. These courses will only earn credit hours towards the student’s degree.  This is also true for Vanderbilt Study Abroad programs, as well as for non-Vanderbilt affiliated study away. Q3 What is the required GPA to graduate? A 2.0 GPA minimum in three areas:  all major courses, all Engineering courses, and all courses taken cumulatively is required to graduate. If a student has met all other requirements but does not have the minimum GPA, he/she will not graduate. Grade Requirements Q1 What is considered a passing grade? A grade of D- or higher is considered a passing grade. A grade of ‘F’ is not passing. Leave of Absence Q1 What is a leave of absence? A leave of absence allows students to interrupt their studies for one or two fall/spring semesters. Students can take either a medical leave or a personal leave",

    "text": ". A grade of ‘F’ is not passing. Leave of Absence Q1 What is a leave of absence? A leave of absence allows students to interrupt their studies for one or two fall/spring semesters. Students can take either a medical leave or a personal leave. Medical leaves are usually recommended by a medical professional and require medical clearance prior to returning to your studies. Personal leaves require clearance by Engineering Administration, but do not usually require clearance to return to campus. Reasons for a leave may include but are not limited to: participation in a non-academic program, working to earn money, attending to a family crisis, or gaining a sense of direction. Please see the above section on 'Academic Standing' for additonal information on a required leave of absence. Q2 How do I apply for a leave of absence? Contact the Office of Academic Services to discuss dates, deadlines, and other options that might be appropriate.  Students will then be asked to complete a ‘Request for Leave of Absence’ form’. You may later request an extension to a third fall/spring semester if necessary. Q3 How do I return from a leave of absence? Returning from a personal leave does not require any special permissions assuming that you return during the semester that you anticipated returning when initiating your leave of absence.  Returning from medical leave requires medical clearance. You can learn how to receive that clearance here",

It is highly recommended that the student meets with a staff member in the Office of Academic Services.  Appointments can be made by calling the Office of Academic Services at (615) 343-8061. Students may also choose to meet with their faculty adviser. Q2 How do I view my midterm deficiency? The midterm deficiency letter is accessible via Your Enrollment System (YES). It can be located by navigating to ‘Academic Record’ then ‘Academic Detail’ under the Semester in which the deficiency letter was received. Q3 What resources are available to help me overcome academic struggles? Many Vanderbilt students find themselves challenged by their classes for the first time and discover they need to \"learn\" how to study. Vanderbilt offers a range of supportive services to help students through this transition, including STEM tutoring via the Penji application. The Center for Student Wellbeing (CSW) also provides individual appointments and group workshops on academic skills and strategies. The CSW provides learning and information processing training for students who often understand course material but have difficulty applying it on exams, as well as workshops on time and task management, stress management, and test preparation strategies",

It depends upon your classification, major, and the course you desire to take Pass/Fail From the Undergraduate Catalog: Pass/Fail Course Provision Students may elect to take a limited number of courses on a Pass/Fail basis. To enroll for a course on a Pass/Fail basis, students must have completed at least two semesters at Vanderbilt, must have achieved at least sophomore standing, and must not be on academic probation. In addition, the following regulations apply to students enrolled in the School of Engineering: 1.   No more than 9 hours graded P will be accepted toward the B.S. or B.E. degree, as designated by each program's curriculum. Pass/Fail Electives Options by Program Open Liberal Arts Core Technical BME X X CEE X X ChBE X CompE X CS X X X EE/ECE X ES X X ME X X X (non-ME) 2.   No more than two courses may be taken on a Pass/Fail basis in any one semester. 3.   A minimum of 12 hours must be taken on a graded basis in any semester that a Pass/Fail course is taken. A graduating senior who needs fewer than 12 hours to graduate may take courses on a Pass/Fail basis as long as he or she takes the number of hours needed to graduate on a graded basis. 4",

Students may change from Pass/Fail to graded status until the deadline to withdraw for the semester. The deadline is posted on the Academic Calendar found on the Registrar's website. Those electing the Pass/Fail option must meet all course requirements (e.g., reports, papers, examinations, attendance, etc.) and are graded in the normal way. Instructors are not informed of the names of students enrolled on a Pass/Fail basis. At the end of the semester, a regular grade is submitted for the student enrolled under the P/F option. Any grade of D- or above is converted in the Student Records System to a P, while an F will be recorded if a student enrolled under this option fails the course. The P grade is not counted in the grade point average nor used in the determination of honors. The grade of F earned under the Pass/Fail option is included in the calculation of the grade point average. Q2 How do I change a class from a letter grade to Pass/Fail?

Please contact Dean Cynthia Paschal via email (Cynthia.paschal@vanderbilt.edu) for permission if you would like to take more than 18 hours. Q1 Where can I find my current GPA? A student’s GPA can be found on YES under the ‘Academic Record’ and ‘Academic Detail’. Q2 If I take classes at another school, are those grades included in my Vanderbilt GPA? No, the grades earned at another institution and transferred back to Vanderbilt will not count towards your Vanderbilt GPA. These courses will only earn credit hours towards the student’s degree.  This is also true for Vanderbilt Study Abroad programs, as well as for non-Vanderbilt affiliated study away. Q3 What is the required GPA to graduate? A 2.0 GPA minimum in three areas:  all major courses, all Engineering courses, and all courses taken cumulatively is required to graduate. If a student has met all other requirements but does not have the minimum GPA, he/she will not graduate. Q1 What is considered a passing grade? A grade of D- or higher is considered a passing grade. A grade of ‘F’ is not passing. Q1 What is a leave of absence? A leave of absence allows students to interrupt their studies for one or two fall/spring semesters. Students can take either a medical leave or a personal leave",

    "text": ". A grade of ‘F’ is not passing. Q1 What is a leave of absence? A leave of absence allows students to interrupt their studies for one or two fall/spring semesters. Students can take either a medical leave or a personal leave. Medical leaves are usually recommended by a medical professional and require medical clearance prior to returning to your studies. Personal leaves require clearance by Engineering Administration, but do not usually require clearance to return to campus. Reasons for a leave may include but are not limited to: participation in a non-academic program, working to earn money, attending to a family crisis, or gaining a sense of direction. Please see the above section on 'Academic Standing' for additonal information on a required leave of absence. Q2 How do I apply for a leave of absence? Contact the Office of Academic Services to discuss dates, deadlines, and other options that might be appropriate.  Students will then be asked to complete a ‘Request for Leave of Absence’ form’. You may later request an extension to a third fall/spring semester if necessary. Q3 How do I return from a leave of absence? Returning from a personal leave does not require any special permissions assuming that you return during the semester that you anticipated returning when initiating your leave of absence.  Returning from medical leave requires medical clearance.

Students planning to graduate in three years may request to change their expected graduation term (EGT) after the completion o ftheir fourth regular semester in residence; those planning to graduate one semester early may request to change their EGT after the completion of their fifth regular semester. Such requests much include a semester-by-semester plan showing how they will meet graduation requirements by the conclusion of their new expected graduation term. The plan must meet all prerequisite streams and be feasible based on course schedules available at the time of plan creation. The request also must include the approval/ endorsement of the Director of Undergraduate Studies in their major. Q1 What is the degree audit and how does it work? The degree audit is an academic advising document that maps a student’s degree requirements against their academic transcript. Q2 Why do I need to look at my degree audit? The purpose of the audit is to provide information to assist in academic planning and appropriate course scheduling. It is important for students to consistently view the audit by refreshing it to ensure they are on track with their requirements. It is also the student’s responsibility to seek out a correction if anything is incorrect on the audit",

By the time students become juniors, they have begun to choose some specialization through their coursework and we find this is a great time to begin to engage in research. We have also found that research experience as an undergraduate makes students extremely competitive for graduate school, graduate fellowships and prestigious scholarships. To learn about the guidelines for seeking research opportunities, please visit the undergraduate research website",

Check the message carefully. If you can't figure it out, contact the YES help desk (\"Help\" on the upper right corner of the page) before you panic! Q4  Why am I getting a requisite error when I meet the co-requisite and pre-requisite requirements? For classes that have co-requisite labs, discussions, or modules (for instance, ES 1401,1402, and 1403), you MUST have a seat (not a spot on the waitlist) in each component to get a spot in the class.  That is, if there is an available seat in the lecture component of course, but there is not an available seat in your preferred lab component, the enrollment transaction will not work for either component. You should choose a different lab (with available seats) and then use the drop if enrolled . Q5  Why do a get a class capacity error or placed on the waitlist when there are seats available in a course? This could be for one of two reasons: The seats that remain available have been reserved for specific populations of students.  For example, the Math department typically reserves a portion of all Fall calculus courses (1300, 1301, and 2300) for incoming students.  Other departments reserve a portion of seats for student within their major or minor groups",

    "text": ". The course in which you are attempting to enroll is combined with a graduate class and the combined capacity for both courses has been met.  When this happens, it can appear that there are seats available that are in fact filled by graduate students in the affiliated listing. Q6 Does Vanderbilt offer summer engineering classes? Some Engineering courses are typically offered during the summer semesters, though offerings are limited. Foundational courses in mathematics, physics and chemistry, as well as courses in the liberal arts fields, are offered. Waitlisting Q1 Can I get a seat in a class that is full? You may choose to place yourself on the waitlist for most classes (this will not happen automatically). The waitlist is an optional function that allows students to sign-up for a course that is closed. Students who are waitlisted for a course are not registered but are waiting to register for the course. Q2 Why do some classes have no waitlist? Waitlist options are determined by Vanderbilt departments. If there is no wait list for a class you will need to check the class periodically for open seats. Q1 How do I add my classes?

Q3 I get an Error message when trying to enroll ---does it mean YES is not working? No, it means that your action created an error. You should read the message carefully to see why there is an error. You might not meet the prerequisites for the class, or perhaps the class requires permission of the instructor. Check the message carefully",

Check the message carefully. If you can't figure it out, contact the YES help desk (\"Help\" on the upper right corner of the page) before you panic! Q4  Why am I getting a requisite error when I meet the co-requisite and pre-requisite requirements? For classes that have co-requisite labs, discussions, or modules (for instance, ES 1401,1402, and 1403), you MUST have a seat (not a spot on the waitlist) in each component to get a spot in the class.  That is, if there is an available seat in the lecture component of course, but there is not an available seat in your preferred lab component, the enrollment transaction will not work for either component. You should choose a different lab (with available seats) and then use the drop if enrolled . Q5  Why do a get a class capacity error or placed on the waitlist when there are seats available in a course? This could be for one of two reasons: The seats that remain available have been reserved for specific populations of students.  For example, the Math department typically reserves a portion of all Fall calculus courses (1300, 1301, and 2300) for incoming students.  Other departments reserve a portion of seats for student within their major or minor groups",

    "text": ". The course in which you are attempting to enroll is combined with a graduate class and the combined capacity for both courses has been met.  When this happens, it can appear that there are seats available that are in fact filled by graduate students in the affiliated listing. Q6 Does Vanderbilt offer summer engineering classes? Some Engineering courses are typically offered during the summer semesters, though offerings are limited. Foundational courses in mathematics, physics and chemistry, as well as courses in the liberal arts fields, are offered. Q1 Can I get a seat in a class that is full? You may choose to place yourself on the waitlist for most classes (this will not happen automatically). The waitlist is an optional function that allows students to sign-up for a course that is closed. Students who are waitlisted for a course are not registered but are waiting to register for the course. Q2 Why do some classes have no waitlist? Waitlist options are determined by Vanderbilt departments. If there is no wait list for a class you will need to check the class periodically for open seats.

    "text": "Mechanobiology Center Contact Us Events Mechanobiology Publications Mission Statement The mission of the Vanderbilt Center on Mechanobiology is to bring together engineers and basic scientists to understand how mechanics integrates with molecules, cells, and tissues to impact human health and technology. We are training the next generation of researchers to tackle scientific problems at the intersection of biology and mechanics. About Mechanobiology is a cross-disciplinary field at the interface of biology, physics and engineering that seeks to provide fundamental insight into how mechanical forces drive cellular processes. The human body is much more than just a set of genes and proteins, and we now know that disease can be caused and promoted by factors beyond genetics. Almost every organ, tissue, and cell are exposed to mechanical forces, and these forces are integral to healthy cellular function. Elucidating the role of mechanical forces at molecular, cellular and tissue levels offers the potential to impact human health in news ways. Our understanding of mechanotransduction (how cells translate physical forces into chemical signals) is still developing and has been proven to be critical in numerous physiological systems and disease states including cancer, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease and fibrosis",

Research in mechanobiology aims to uncover how cells respond to physical forces and how these forces affect tissue formation, degeneration and regeneration in both basic physiology and disease. Furthermore, mechanomedicine offers the ability to target disease based on the manipulation of the mechanical properties of molecules, cells and tissues, taking medicine into a new frontier. Mechanobiology also impacts biotechnologies from catalysis to biomanufacturing, bioconversion and sustainable energy production. Mechanobiology principles lead to new materials, new forms of manufacturing, sensing and sustainability practices. Vanderbilt is at the forefront of mechanobiology research due to its close cooperation between basic sciences, engineering and medicine.
