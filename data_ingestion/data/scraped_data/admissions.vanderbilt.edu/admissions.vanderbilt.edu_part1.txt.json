Students must designate Vanderbilt as their first-choice school with the National Merit Corporation by the deadlines set by the National Merit Corporation and enroll as an entering first-year student to receive Vanderbilt's National Merit Scholarship. For those finalists who also receive one of Vanderbilt's merit scholarships, we guarantee an additional $2,000 in National Merit total scholarship dollars per year from all sources (with Vanderbilt supplementing any smaller corporate or one-time National Merit Corporation awards). Those finalists who do not receive an additional merit scholarship from Vanderbilt will receive a total of $5,000 per year in National Merit scholarship from all sources (with Vanderbilt supplementing any smaller corporate or one-time National Merit Corporation awards). To receive need-based aid, Vanderbilt requires the College Scholarship Service (CSS) Financial Aid PROFILE and the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Both the FAFSA and CSS Profile can be found online. Army and Navy ROTC programs are active on the Vanderbilt campus. Students who participate in the Navy ROTC program have the option of commissioning into the Marine Corps upon graduation.

Students can participate in Air Force ROTC programs through nearby Tennessee State University. Scholarship students in the Army or Navy ROTC programs receive full tuition, fees, a book allowance, uniforms, and a monthly stipend that increases each year in which they are in the program. Scholarship students in Air Force ROTC can receive scholarships varying from $3,000 up to full-tuition scholarships based on your scholarship type, which may also include money for some fees, books, and a monthly stipend. Vanderbilt provides all students receiving ROTC scholarships an additional $6,000 per year toward any other expenses. If your family has additional demonstrated need, you can apply and possibly qualify for need-based financial aid. Scholarship funding received from organizations outside of Vanderbilt will typically be added on top of any merit-based scholarship award from Vanderbilt up to the cost of attendance (COA). If a student is receiving need-based financial assistance, outside scholarships/sources must be taken into account as part of a student‘s total need-based aid package and cannot be counted as part of the Expected Family Contribution (EFC). If an adjustment to a need-based financial aid package is necessary, the outside scholarship will be used first to replace a student‘s earnings expectation before reducing Vanderbilt need-based assistance",

The Ingram Scholars Program recognizes students who plan to combine a professional or business career with an entrepreneurial spirit and exceptional commitment to civic-minded service, innovation, and leadership.

    "text": "Apply Overview & Philosophy Vanderbilt uses a holistic admissions review process — we do not employ cutoffs for standardized testing or grade point averages. Rather we look for students who have demonstrated strong academic skills and intellectual curiosity, and who have engaged in activities outside the classroom that have nurtured their growth as leaders. Most successful applicants have taken a very rigorous course load and have challenged themselves at the highest levels of the available curriculum. Note that Vanderbilt does not consider demonstrated interest in the admissions review process. Three Ways to Apply: Coalition, powered by Scoir Common Application QuestBridge Choose the application system that is right for you - we do not prefer one over the others. Do not submit an application through more than one system. Choose one application, and submit all required materials through that method. Please note: In addition to submitting the application for admission, applicants to Blair also submit the Blair School of Music Application , which includes a pre-screening video. Access & Belonging In the spirit of Vanderbilt admissions, we consider each application within the context of a high volume, highly selective admissions process. Every applicant is treated with dignity and respect, and we train our readers to find reasons to admit each candidate rather than reasons to deny",

Decision Plans Vanderbilt offers three decision plans for first-year applicants: Early Decision I, Early Decision II, and Regular Decision. Early Decision I and II are binding decision plans and are appropriate for students who are committed to attending Vanderbilt if they are admitted. The applicant, a parent or guardian, and the high school counselor must sign the Early Decision Agreement, indicating the student’s commitment to attend Vanderbilt if offered admission. If the student is admitted to Vanderbilt, they must immediately withdraw applications to all other colleges and universities. Regular Decision is non-binding and permits students to apply to any number of schools and to make their matriculation decision in the month of April, after all admission decisions are known. Early Decision applicants undergo the same thorough review for need-based financial assistance and merit scholarships as Regular Decision applicants. Note: Applicants may change their Vanderbilt decision plan via the MyAppVU portal .  Decision plan changes can be submitted only up to 2 weeks after the decision plan deadline. The Early Decision Agreement is required for students who change their decision plan to Early Decision I or II",

What's the maximum income that my family can have and still qualify? Income is only one consideration when awarding need-based financial aid. Other factors matter as well, such as family size, number of children in college, family assets, etc. There is not a specific income that would automatically disqualify a family from receiving need-based aid.

However, all merit-based scholarship consideration occurs in February and March, so students admitted to Vanderbilt Early Decision will not be notified of any merit-based scholarship offers until late March (when Regular Decision candidates are also notified). Most merit scholarships at Vanderbilt are offered without regard to any specific intended major. However, a number of major-based-scholarships are offered to students admitted to the Blair School of Music. The application for the Cornelius Vanderbilt Scholarship is required; you must apply to be considered. For the Ingram Scholarship Program and Chancellor's Scholarship, the application is strongly encouraged; preference is given to those who apply. Students who wish to be considered for additional merit scholarships are encouraged to complete the Cornelius Vanderbilt Scholarship application. You may apply for merit scholarships via MyAppVU after submitting your application for admission. More information can be found on the Scholarships website . Yes.  As a Division I athletic program that competes in ten women’s and six men’s sports, interested students should refer to our official athletic site for more details about how the scholarship process works for their particular sport.

Students must designate Vanderbilt as their first-choice school with the National Merit Corporation by the deadlines set by the National Merit Corporation and enroll as an entering first-year student to receive Vanderbilt's National Merit Scholarship. For those finalists who also receive one of Vanderbilt's merit scholarships, we guarantee an additional $2,000 in National Merit total scholarship dollars per year from all sources (with Vanderbilt supplementing any smaller corporate or one-time National Merit Corporation awards). Those finalists who do not receive an additional merit scholarship from Vanderbilt will receive a total of $5,000 per year in National Merit scholarship from all sources (with Vanderbilt supplementing any smaller corporate or one-time National Merit Corporation awards). To receive need-based aid, Vanderbilt requires the College Scholarship Service (CSS) Financial Aid PROFILE and the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Both the FAFSA and CSS Profile can be found online. Army and Navy ROTC programs are active on the Vanderbilt campus. Students who participate in the Navy ROTC program have the option of commissioning into the Marine Corps upon graduation.

Students can participate in Air Force ROTC programs through nearby Tennessee State University. Scholarship students in the Army or Navy ROTC programs receive full tuition, fees, a book allowance, uniforms, and a monthly stipend that increases each year in which they are in the program. Scholarship students in Air Force ROTC can receive scholarships varying from $3,000 up to full-tuition scholarships based on your scholarship type, which may also include money for some fees, books, and a monthly stipend. Vanderbilt provides all students receiving ROTC scholarships an additional $6,000 per year toward any other expenses. If your family has additional demonstrated need, you can apply and possibly qualify for need-based financial aid. Scholarship funding received from organizations outside of Vanderbilt will typically be added on top of any merit-based scholarship award from Vanderbilt up to the cost of attendance (COA). If a student is receiving need-based financial assistance, outside scholarships/sources must be taken into account as part of a student‘s total need-based aid package and cannot be counted as part of the Expected Family Contribution (EFC). If an adjustment to a need-based financial aid package is necessary, the outside scholarship will be used first to replace a student‘s earnings expectation before reducing Vanderbilt need-based assistance",

The Ingram Scholars Program recognizes students who plan to combine a professional or business career with an entrepreneurial spirit and exceptional commitment to civic-minded service, innovation, and leadership. The Chancellor’s Scholarship recognizes students with outstanding academic records who have worked to build strong high school communities by bridging gaps among economically, socially, and racially diverse groups, and have demonstrated significant interest in issues of diversity education, tolerance, and social justice.

These awards range from partial to full tuition and are renewable through four years of undergraduate study as long as the student maintains satisfactory academic performance. Financial need, unless otherwise specified, is not a factor. Vanderbilt awards a number of scholarships to students choosing to enroll in any of the four undergraduate schools, including our three signature, full-tuition awards: The Ingram Scholars Program, the Cornelius Vanderbilt Scholarship, and the Chancellor’s Scholarship . Detailed descriptions of these awards can be found on the Scholarships website . Additional awards include: the Carell Family Scholarship for students who have held part-time employment during their high school years; the John Siegenthaler Scholarship for outstanding minority students interested in a career in journalism and/or public policy; the Fred Russell-Grantland Rice Scholarship for students interested in pursuing a career in sports journalism; and the Curb Leadership Scholarship for students who place creativity and innovation at the center of their lives and use their talents and leadership to create new possibilities",

Rather we look for students who have demonstrated strong academic skills and intellectual curiosity, and who have engaged in activities outside the classroom that have nurtured their growth as leaders. Most successful applicants have taken a very rigorous course load and have challenged themselves at the highest levels of the available curriculum. Note that Vanderbilt does not consider demonstrated interest in the admissions review process. Three Ways to Apply: Coalition, powered by Scoir Common Application QuestBridge Choose the application system that is right for you - we do not prefer one over the others. Do not submit an application through more than one system. Choose one application, and submit all required materials through that method. Please note: In addition to submitting the application for admission, applicants to Blair also submit the Blair School of Music Application , which includes a pre-screening video. Access & Belonging In the spirit of Vanderbilt admissions, we consider each application within the context of a high volume, highly selective admissions process. Every applicant is treated with dignity and respect, and we train our readers to find reasons to admit each candidate rather than reasons to deny",

Decision Plans Vanderbilt offers three decision plans for first-year applicants: Early Decision I, Early Decision II, and Regular Decision. Early Decision I and II are binding decision plans and are appropriate for students who are committed to attending Vanderbilt if they are admitted. The applicant, a parent or guardian, and the high school counselor must sign the Early Decision Agreement, indicating the student’s commitment to attend Vanderbilt if offered admission. If the student is admitted to Vanderbilt, they must immediately withdraw applications to all other colleges and universities. Regular Decision is non-binding and permits students to apply to any number of schools and to make their matriculation decision in the month of April, after all admission decisions are known. Early Decision applicants undergo the same thorough review for need-based financial assistance and merit scholarships as Regular Decision applicants. Note: Applicants may change their Vanderbilt decision plan via the MyAppVU portal .  Decision plan changes can be submitted only up to 2 weeks after the decision plan deadline. The Early Decision Agreement is required for students who change their decision plan to Early Decision I or II",

Because of our location in Tennessee, a top-five state for percentage of rural high school students, we are uniquely positioned to work with these talented students who live in our own backyard. To elevate and empower rural populations, Vanderbilt has implemented a comprehensive, integrated statewide outreach plan including on-the-ground outreach, programming on the Vanderbilt campus, webinars, and professional development opportunities for rural educators. We know that students who live in small towns and rural areas play a unique role at Vanderbilt as we dare to grow! In Tennessee, rural students make up 29 percent of the population; compared to the national median, our state has three rural students to one. We have a responsibility to engage with these students and their families to help them prepare for college and understand their options, whether they choose Vanderbilt or not. We must also ensure that the rural students admitted to Vanderbilt have no doubt that they belong here when they arrive on our campus.

At Vanderbilt, our emphasis on community brings students, faculty, and staff together in a living and learning environment where scholarship and friendship thrive side-by-side. Balance is key to any Vanderbilt student’s success. While the academics are challenging, our students still find time to take a break and enjoy their college experience. With more than 450 student organizations, intramural and club sports, the vibrant city of Nashville, and frequent concerts and guest lectures, you always have plenty of opportunities to recharge and stay inspired. “I chose Vanderbilt because as soon as I stepped on campus I could tell how supportive, kind, and invested the community was.” Housing and Dining The Martha Rivers Ingram Commons is composed of ten houses designed exclusively for first-year students and their faculty heads of house, a dining center, seminar/study rooms, generous public spaces, and endless opportunities for engagement, enrichment, and leadership. The experiences while living on The Commons promote a sense of community, personal wellbeing, self-discovery, intellectual development, and cultural awareness—setting up students for the beginning of their journey through a Vanderbilt undergraduate education. “Something that is ‘Common’ is something that is familiar, frequent, and ubiquitous. It is something that you can count on, something that happens every day",

Whether it’s a quick smile and hello as you grab a coffee on the way to class, a longer conversation over a meal, or a late-night study session in close proximity to snacks, The Commons Center is our place for our community to grow and thrive.” Many upper-division students extend the dynamic living-learning experience of The Commons through Vanderbilt's growing residential college system including Carmichael College, E. Bronson Ingram College, Moore College, Nicholas S. Zeppos College, Rothschild College and Warren College. Other residential options for upper-division students include suite-style, apartment-style, or themed housing. Dining together creates a sense of place and kinship, not only sustaining our bodies, but our community and environment as well. Vanderbilt Campus Dining provides a key element of the residential experience by serving high-quality, nutritious dining options, with award-winning chefs and culinary teams.
