Students can request a matriculation deposit extension from the Office of Undergraduate Admissions if your financial aid award offer is still under review.\u00a0 The Office of Student Financial Aid can be contacted at 615-322-3591 or via email at finaid@vanderbilt.edu . It is important to remember that Vanderbilt practices a need-blind admissions process and is committed to meeting 100% of every family\u2019s demonstrated need through gift aid and a reasonable expectation of student work. Our Net Price Calculator can be used as a tool to estimate the amount of need-based financial aid your family may receive, but we will not know what exactly your package will entail until you officially apply by submitting the FAFSA and the CSS Profile",

Just because your neighbor lives in a house that looks similar to yours, or your parents work at similar jobs, doesn\u2018t mean that you have similar financial need. Many different criteria are assessed when considering your eligibility for financial aid at Vanderbilt. Based upon the financial data submitted on the College Scholarship Service (CSS) Financial Aid PROFILE and the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), your family situation will be reviewed to determine an Expected Family Contribution (EFC). After your EFC has been determined, we will calculate the difference between the cost of attending Vanderbilt and the contribution expected from your family. This difference between the Cost of Attendance (COA) and your EFC is your family\u2018s demonstrated need. Vanderbilt will meet 100% of this need without loans, through a combination of grants, scholarships and earnings from work expectation. Under certain conditions, and based upon individual family circumstances or desires, loans from federal and/or other sources may ultimately be made available to students upon their request to replace any earnings expectation in their award or to replace some portion of their family\u2018s expected contribution. The Federal Work-Study Program (FWSP) provides part-time employment opportunities for students with financial need",

Scholarship funding received from organizations outside of Vanderbilt will typically be added on top of any merit-based scholarship award from Vanderbilt up to the cost of attendance (COA). If a student is receiving need-based financial assistance, outside scholarships/sources must be taken into account as part of a student\u2018s total need-based aid package and cannot be counted as part of the Expected Family Contribution (EFC).

Under certain conditions and based upon individual family circumstances or desires, loans from federal and/or other sources may ultimately be made available to students upon their request to replace any earnings expectation in their award or to replace some portion of their family\u2018s expected contribution. It is important to start early and do your research through books, online, and at financial aid workshops offered at your high school or local community. When applying for aid, read the directions, pay attention to deadlines, and make sure you submit all appropriate documents. Institutional aid is money awarded by Vanderbilt University. Most institutional aid is in the form of grants and scholarships. Federal aid is money awarded by the government in the form of grants, loans, and work study",

Rather we look for students who have demonstrated strong academic skills and intellectual curiosity, and who have engaged in activities outside the classroom that have nurtured their growth as leaders. Most successful applicants have taken a very rigorous course load and have challenged themselves at the highest levels of the available curriculum. Note that Vanderbilt does not consider demonstrated interest in the admissions review process. Three Ways to Apply: Coalition, powered by Scoir Common Application QuestBridge Choose the application system that is right for you - we do not prefer one over the others. Do not submit an application through more than one system. Choose one application, and submit all required materials through that method. Please note: In addition to submitting the application for admission, applicants to Blair also submit the Blair School of Music Application , which includes a pre-screening video. Access & Belonging In the spirit of Vanderbilt admissions, we consider each application within the context of a high volume, highly selective admissions process. Every applicant is treated with dignity and respect, and we train our readers to find reasons to admit each candidate rather than reasons to deny",

Decision Plans Vanderbilt offers three decision plans for first-year applicants: Early Decision I, Early Decision II, and Regular Decision. Early Decision I and II are binding decision plans and are appropriate for students who are committed to attending Vanderbilt if they are admitted. The applicant, a parent or guardian, and the high school counselor must sign the Early Decision Agreement, indicating the student\u2019s commitment to attend Vanderbilt if offered admission. If the student is admitted to Vanderbilt, they must immediately withdraw applications to all other colleges and universities. Regular Decision is non-binding and permits students to apply to any number of schools and to make their matriculation decision in the month of April, after all admission decisions are known. Early Decision applicants undergo the same thorough review for need-based financial assistance and merit scholarships as Regular Decision applicants. Note: Applicants may change their Vanderbilt decision plan via the MyAppVU portal .\u00a0 Decision plan changes can be submitted only up to 2 weeks after the decision plan deadline. The Early Decision Agreement is required for students who change their decision plan to Early Decision I or II",

What's the maximum income that my family can have and still qualify? Income is only one consideration when awarding need-based financial aid. Other factors matter as well, such as family size, number of children in college, family assets, etc. There is not a specific income that would automatically disqualify a family from receiving need-based aid. Applying for aid by filling out the FAFSA and the CSS Profile is the only way our Office of Student Financial Aid and Undergraduate Scholarships can determine your eligibility for financial assistance",

Where do I get these forms? To receive need-based aid, Vanderbilt requires the College Scholarship Service (CSS) Financial Aid PROFILE and the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Both the FAFSA and CSS Profile can be found online. I can't afford the application fee, what do I do?

I received an outside scholarship, how will that affect my need-based aid package? Historically, Vanderbilt students have been very successful in obtaining outside scholarships or other sources of financial assistance. These outside scholarships/sources must be taken into account as part of a student\u2018s total need-based aid package and cannot be counted as part of the Expected Family Contribution (EFC). If an adjustment to a need-based financial aid package is necessary, the outside scholarship will be used first to replace a student\u2018s earnings expectation before reducing Vanderbilt need-based assistance. I received an ROTC scholarship, how does that work? Army and Navy ROTC programs are active on the Vanderbilt campus. Students who participate in the Navy ROTC program have the option of commissioning into the Marine Corps upon graduation.

However, all merit-based scholarship consideration occurs in February and March, so students admitted to Vanderbilt Early Decision will not be notified of any merit-based scholarship offers until late March (when Regular Decision candidates are also notified). Most merit scholarships at Vanderbilt are offered without regard to any specific intended major. However, a number of major-based-scholarships are offered to students admitted to the Blair School of Music. The application for the Cornelius Vanderbilt Scholarship is required; you must apply to be considered. For the Ingram Scholarship Program and Chancellor's Scholarship, the application is strongly encouraged; preference is given to those who apply. Students who wish to be considered for additional merit scholarships are encouraged to complete the Cornelius Vanderbilt Scholarship application. You may apply for merit scholarships via MyAppVU after submitting your application for admission. More information can be found on the Scholarships website .

Students must designate Vanderbilt as their first-choice school with the National Merit Corporation by the deadlines set by the National Merit Corporation and enroll as an entering first-year student to receive Vanderbilt's National Merit Scholarship. For those finalists who also receive one of Vanderbilt's merit scholarships, we guarantee an additional $2,000 in National Merit total scholarship dollars per year from all sources (with Vanderbilt supplementing any smaller corporate or one-time National Merit Corporation awards). Those finalists who do not receive an additional merit scholarship from Vanderbilt will receive a total of $5,000 per year in National Merit scholarship from all sources (with Vanderbilt supplementing any smaller corporate or one-time National Merit Corporation awards). To receive need-based aid, Vanderbilt requires the College Scholarship Service (CSS) Financial Aid PROFILE and the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Both the FAFSA and CSS Profile can be found online. Army and Navy ROTC programs are active on the Vanderbilt campus. Students who participate in the Navy ROTC program have the option of commissioning into the Marine Corps upon graduation.

Students can participate in Air Force ROTC programs through nearby Tennessee State University. Scholarship students in the Army or Navy ROTC programs receive full tuition, fees, a book allowance, uniforms, and a monthly stipend that increases each year in which they are in the program. Scholarship students in Air Force ROTC can receive scholarships varying from $3,000 up to full-tuition scholarships based on your scholarship type, which may also include money for some fees, books, and a monthly stipend. Vanderbilt provides all students receiving ROTC scholarships an additional $6,000 per year toward any other expenses. If your family has additional demonstrated need, you can apply and possibly qualify for need-based financial aid. Scholarship funding received from organizations outside of Vanderbilt will typically be added on top of any merit-based scholarship award from Vanderbilt up to the cost of attendance (COA). If a student is receiving need-based financial assistance, outside scholarships/sources must be taken into account as part of a student\u2018s total need-based aid package and cannot be counted as part of the Expected Family Contribution (EFC).

Rather we look for students who have demonstrated strong academic skills and intellectual curiosity, and who have engaged in activities outside the classroom that have nurtured their growth as leaders. Most successful applicants have taken a very rigorous course load and have challenged themselves at the highest levels of the available curriculum. Note that Vanderbilt does not consider demonstrated interest in the admissions review process. Three Ways to Apply: Coalition, powered by Scoir Common Application QuestBridge Choose the application system that is right for you - we do not prefer one over the others. Do not submit an application through more than one system. Choose one application, and submit all required materials through that method. Please note: In addition to submitting the application for admission, applicants to Blair also submit the Blair School of Music Application , which includes a pre-screening video. Access & Belonging In the spirit of Vanderbilt admissions, we consider each application within the context of a high volume, highly selective admissions process. Every applicant is treated with dignity and respect, and we train our readers to find reasons to admit each candidate rather than reasons to deny",

Decision Plans Vanderbilt offers three decision plans for first-year applicants: Early Decision I, Early Decision II, and Regular Decision. Early Decision I and II are binding decision plans and are appropriate for students who are committed to attending Vanderbilt if they are admitted. The applicant, a parent or guardian, and the high school counselor must sign the Early Decision Agreement, indicating the student\u2019s commitment to attend Vanderbilt if offered admission. If the student is admitted to Vanderbilt, they must immediately withdraw applications to all other colleges and universities. Regular Decision is non-binding and permits students to apply to any number of schools and to make their matriculation decision in the month of April, after all admission decisions are known. Early Decision applicants undergo the same thorough review for need-based financial assistance and merit scholarships as Regular Decision applicants. Note: Applicants may change their Vanderbilt decision plan via the MyAppVU portal .\u00a0 Decision plan changes can be submitted only up to 2 weeks after the decision plan deadline. The Early Decision Agreement is required for students who change their decision plan to Early Decision I or II",

To elevate and empower rural populations, Vanderbilt has implemented a comprehensive, integrated statewide outreach plan including on-the-ground outreach, programming on the Vanderbilt campus, webinars, and professional development opportunities for rural educators. We know that students who live in small towns and rural areas play a unique role at Vanderbilt as we dare to grow!

We have a responsibility to engage with these students and their families to help them prepare for college and understand their options, whether they choose Vanderbilt or not.
