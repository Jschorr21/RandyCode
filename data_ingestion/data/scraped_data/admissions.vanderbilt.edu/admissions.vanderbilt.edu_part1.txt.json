    "text": ". The Federal Work-Study Program (FWSP) provides part-time employment opportunities for students with financial need. FWSP awards are distributed as bi-weekly or monthly paychecks according to the hours worked and hourly wage. Undergraduate students may work up to 20 hours per week. A job fair is held every fall for students who have FWSP as part of their financial aid package to help them find a job on campus. Vanderbilt will meet 100% of demonstrated financial need without loans, through a combination of grants, scholarships and an earnings from work expectation. Under certain conditions and based upon individual family circumstances or desires, loans from federal and/or other sources may ultimately be made available to students upon their request to replace any earnings expectation in their award or to replace some portion of their family‘s expected contribution. It is important to start early and do your research through books, online, and at financial aid workshops offered at your high school or local community. When applying for aid, read the directions, pay attention to deadlines, and make sure you submit all appropriate documents. Institutional aid is money awarded by Vanderbilt University. Most institutional aid is in the form of grants and scholarships. Federal aid is money awarded by the government in the form of grants, loans, and work study",

    "text": ". Vanderbilt provides all students receiving ROTC scholarships an additional $6,000 per year toward any other expenses. If your family has additional demonstrated need, you can apply and possibly qualify for need-based financial aid. If I receive a scholarship from an organization outside of Vanderbilt, how will that impact my scholarship offer from Vanderbilt? Scholarship funding received from organizations outside of Vanderbilt will typically be added on top of any merit-based scholarship award from Vanderbilt up to the cost of attendance (COA). If a student is receiving need-based financial assistance, outside scholarships/sources must be taken into account as part of a student‘s total need-based aid package and cannot be counted as part of the Expected Family Contribution (EFC). If an adjustment to a need-based financial aid package is necessary, the outside scholarship will be used first to replace a student‘s earnings expectation before reducing Vanderbilt need-based assistance. For specific questions about outside scholarship awards, please contact the Office of Student Financial Aid and Undergraduate Scholarships at 800-288-0204. What is the profile of a merit-scholarship recipient at Vanderbilt? Each of our scholarship programs maintains different criteria --therefore the available funding is awarded to students with different “profiles.”  First and foremost, students must excel within the highly competitive and holistic admissions review process",

    "text": "Apply Overview & Philosophy Vanderbilt uses a holistic admissions review process — we do not employ cutoffs for standardized testing or grade point averages. Rather we look for students who have demonstrated strong academic skills and intellectual curiosity, and who have engaged in activities outside the classroom that have nurtured their growth as leaders. Most successful applicants have taken a very rigorous course load and have challenged themselves at the highest levels of the available curriculum. Note that Vanderbilt does not consider demonstrated interest in the admissions review process. Three Ways to Apply: Coalition, powered by Scoir Common Application QuestBridge Choose the application system that is right for you - we do not prefer one over the others. Do not submit an application through more than one system. Choose one application, and submit all required materials through that method. Please note: In addition to submitting the application for admission, applicants to Blair also submit the Blair School of Music Application , which includes a pre-screening video. Access & Belonging In the spirit of Vanderbilt admissions, we consider each application within the context of a high volume, highly selective admissions process. Every applicant is treated with dignity and respect, and we train our readers to find reasons to admit each candidate rather than reasons to deny",

Decision Plans Vanderbilt offers three decision plans for first-year applicants: Early Decision I, Early Decision II, and Regular Decision. Early Decision I and II are binding decision plans and are appropriate for students who are committed to attending Vanderbilt if they are admitted. The applicant, a parent or guardian, and the high school counselor must sign the Early Decision Agreement, indicating the student’s commitment to attend Vanderbilt if offered admission. If the student is admitted to Vanderbilt, they must immediately withdraw applications to all other colleges and universities. Regular Decision is non-binding and permits students to apply to any number of schools and to make their matriculation decision in the month of April, after all admission decisions are known. Early Decision applicants undergo the same thorough review for need-based financial assistance and merit scholarships as Regular Decision applicants. Note: Applicants may change their Vanderbilt decision plan via the MyAppVU portal .  Decision plan changes can be submitted only up to 2 weeks after the decision plan deadline. The Early Decision Agreement is required for students who change their decision plan to Early Decision I or II",

Is the academic environment intense? Sure. But you'll also find it collaborative and supportive. Vanderbilt blends a top-tier research university with a teaching-focused liberal arts curriculum. With four undergraduate schools and colleges, over 70 majors, and  over 70 minors, you’re never at a loss for ways to explore your interests or discover new passions. Whether you’re participating in research with faculty, developing your Immersion Vanderbilt project, or even chatting over dinner with your faculty head of house, at Vanderbilt, you’re a part of a collaborative intellectual community. Four Schools At Vanderbilt, we offer world-class academic programs through four undergraduate schools: College of Arts and Science Blair School of Music Peabody College of Education and Human Development School of Engineering Programs of Study At Vanderbilt, we encourage students to study across disciplines to feed their passions and inspire new ways to address issues and impact the world. Over the years, we’ve learned that you can’t contain a neuroscientist’s love of dance any more than a mechanical engineer’s fascination with pre-Columbian tribes – that's why most Vanderbilt students take a variety of classes across our undergraduate schools",

Undergraduate Research At Vanderbilt, you will have the chance not only to absorb and apply invaluable lessons from your professors, but also to take part in their innovations and create new avenues of knowledge for future generations. You’ll join a community of collaborative scholars often engaged in research that spans traditional disciplinary lines. The combination of Vanderbilt’s low 7:1 student-to faculty ratio and the culture of close faculty-student interactions means that undergraduates frequently work one-on-one with faculty engaged in cutting-edge research. \"Once I looked into all of the impressive work that Vanderbilt faculty were up to, I knew I wanted to get involved. Vanderbilt researchers have an impressive array of accolades and interests and I think that there’s something for everyone!\" Immersion Vanderbilt Immersion Vanderbilt calls for each undergraduate student to participate in an intensive learning experience that takes place in and beyond the classroom. Students will have the opportunity to pursue these experiences along four different pathways:  civic and professional, creative expression, international, or research. Immersion Vanderbilt allows students to explore their passions and interests, transforming their ideas into action that makes a difference in the world",

If I receive a scholarship from an organization outside of Vanderbilt, how will that impact my scholarship offer from Vanderbilt? Scholarship funding received from organizations outside of Vanderbilt will typically be added on top of any merit-based scholarship award from Vanderbilt up to the cost of attendance (COA). If a student is receiving need-based financial assistance, outside scholarships/sources must be taken into account as part of a student‘s total need-based aid package and cannot be counted as part of the Expected Family Contribution (EFC). If an adjustment to a need-based financial aid package is necessary, the outside scholarship will be used first to replace a student‘s earnings expectation before reducing Vanderbilt need-based assistance. For specific questions about outside scholarship awards, please contact the Office of Student Financial Aid and Undergraduate Scholarships at 800-288-0204. What is the profile of a merit-scholarship recipient at Vanderbilt?

    "text": "Apply Overview & Philosophy Vanderbilt uses a holistic admissions review process — we do not employ cutoffs for standardized testing or grade point averages. Rather we look for students who have demonstrated strong academic skills and intellectual curiosity, and who have engaged in activities outside the classroom that have nurtured their growth as leaders. Most successful applicants have taken a very rigorous course load and have challenged themselves at the highest levels of the available curriculum. Note that Vanderbilt does not consider demonstrated interest in the admissions review process. Three Ways to Apply: Coalition, powered by Scoir Common Application QuestBridge Choose the application system that is right for you - we do not prefer one over the others. Do not submit an application through more than one system. Choose one application, and submit all required materials through that method. Please note: In addition to submitting the application for admission, applicants to Blair also submit the Blair School of Music Application , which includes a pre-screening video. Access & Belonging In the spirit of Vanderbilt admissions, we consider each application within the context of a high volume, highly selective admissions process. Every applicant is treated with dignity and respect, and we train our readers to find reasons to admit each candidate rather than reasons to deny",

Decision Plans Vanderbilt offers three decision plans for first-year applicants: Early Decision I, Early Decision II, and Regular Decision. Early Decision I and II are binding decision plans and are appropriate for students who are committed to attending Vanderbilt if they are admitted. The applicant, a parent or guardian, and the high school counselor must sign the Early Decision Agreement, indicating the student’s commitment to attend Vanderbilt if offered admission. If the student is admitted to Vanderbilt, they must immediately withdraw applications to all other colleges and universities. Regular Decision is non-binding and permits students to apply to any number of schools and to make their matriculation decision in the month of April, after all admission decisions are known. Early Decision applicants undergo the same thorough review for need-based financial assistance and merit scholarships as Regular Decision applicants. Note: Applicants may change their Vanderbilt decision plan via the MyAppVU portal .  Decision plan changes can be submitted only up to 2 weeks after the decision plan deadline. The Early Decision Agreement is required for students who change their decision plan to Early Decision I or II",

The experiences while living on The Commons promote a sense of community, personal wellbeing, self-discovery, intellectual development, and cultural awareness—setting up students for the beginning of their journey through a Vanderbilt undergraduate education. “Something that is ‘Common’ is something that is familiar, frequent, and ubiquitous.

We commit to integrity and accountability across all aspects of life—personally, professionally, and academically. Open – We strive to openly engage with ideas, experiences, and with one another.
