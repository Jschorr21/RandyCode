Skeptics, novices, and\u00a0those with developed interests in digital scholarship are all welcome.  The phrase Digital Humanities (DH) is an umbrella term used to describe research, projects, public communication, and teaching at the intersection of digital technology and humanities research. A core principle of humanities scholarship holds that understanding the cultural record of human expression and human experience \u2013 literature, history, philosophy, arts and languages\u2014can enrich the lives of all. Digital Humanities maintains a focus on human questions: enduring ones from ancient times and new ones brought to the fore by our digital lives today. At the same time, digital humanities expands and updates the practices of humanities scholarship. In addition to introducing new technologies to humanities research, such as computational text analysis, digital archives, or 3D modeling of virtual environments, the digital humanities introduce new modes and modalities of humanities research and communication",

The Center for Digital Humanities at Vanderbilt aims to create a flourishing environment for innovative exploration at the intersection of digital technology and humanities research by providing learning experiences, project support, and opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration. We are open to undergraduates, faculty, staff, doctoral students, postdocs, and the greater Nashville DH community. We promote public scholarship and partnership-building, and we serve as a point of contact for our members, connecting humanities researchers with partners at other institutions, with synergistic colleagues across campus, or within support areas like the libraries. Graduate education constitutes a core pillar of our mission. Through our fellowship program and digital working groups, we aim to introduce doctoral students from humanities departments across the University to a wealth of new skills and possibilities. We aim to ensure that a humanities PhD from Vanderbilt opens up a world of professional opportunities for Vanderbilt\u2018s graduate students, despite declining numbers of new professorial jobs in the humanities worldwide.

Initiatives and Programs Immersion Vanderbilt calls for each undergraduate student to participate in an intensive learning experience that takes place in and beyond the classroom and culminates in the creation of an academic product. Students will engage in a civic and professional, creative expression, international, or research immersion experience. Examples include writing and producing a musical, studying the workings of cells in a lab, traveling to Guatemala to repair medical equipment, or working on a project designed to understand human behavior. Vanderbilt is committed to supporting and retaining outstanding faculty who have recently received tenure. The Chancellor Faculty Fellows represent the future of our institution. They offer energy and innovation for new basic discoveries, path breaking scholarship and creative expression. By investing in a select group of younger scholars from across the campus, Vanderbilt is helping to advance their careers at a critical time while providing a forum to share their academic interests with others on campus that build and enrich our One Vanderbilt community.

History Settled in 1779 along the banks of the Cumberland River, Nashville became Tennessee\u2019s state capital in 1843. Just 30 years later, Vanderbilt University was founded\u2014marking the start of an enduring relationship between a dynamic Southern city and a world-class research institution. Climate Nashville\u2019s climate is often characterized as mild, with colder winter months and high temperatures in the summer. Most of the city\u2019s rain occurs during the spring, and if a snowfall does occur, it\u2019s seldom heavy. Campus life at Vanderbilt benefits tremendously from the city\u2019s temperate weather, as outdoor activities can typically occur throughout the academic year. Transportation While several restaurants and cultural attractions are within easy walking distance of Vanderbilt\u2019s campus, ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft also are widely available throughout Nashville. For getting into and out of the city, the award-winning Nashville International Airport provides nonstop flights to 75 markets, including Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, London, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C",

Today, the university\u2019s Honor System is led by eight student-run councils. Each council serves to uphold and protect the Honor Code and to educate members of the Vanderbilt community about the importance of academic integrity. While the Undergraduate Honor Council is comprised of approximately 90 members representing all four undergraduate schools, each graduate and professional school houses its own graduate and/or professional student honor council. Each of these councils is responsible for adjudicating matters of academic dishonesty reported within their school or college. Students, faculty and staff should report suspected Honor Code violations involving undergraduate students by using the Honor Code Incident Reporting Form . Incidents involving graduate and professional students should be reported to the respective honor council. Contact information for each of the graduate and professional honor councils is available here . Statement of the Honor Code Vanderbilt University students pursue all academic endeavors with integrity. They conduct themselves honorably, professionally, and respectfully in all realms of their studies in order to promote and secure an atmosphere of dignity and trust",

Skeptics, novices, and\u00a0those with developed interests in digital scholarship are all welcome.  The phrase Digital Humanities (DH) is an umbrella term used to describe research, projects, public communication, and teaching at the intersection of digital technology and humanities research. A core principle of humanities scholarship holds that understanding the cultural record of human expression and human experience \u2013 literature, history, philosophy, arts and languages\u2014can enrich the lives of all. Digital Humanities maintains a focus on human questions: enduring ones from ancient times and new ones brought to the fore by our digital lives today. At the same time, digital humanities expands and updates the practices of humanities scholarship. In addition to introducing new technologies to humanities research, such as computational text analysis, digital archives, or 3D modeling of virtual environments, the digital humanities introduce new modes and modalities of humanities research and communication",

These offerings include conversations on justice and the common good, on addressing ethical issues relevant to the professions, and on developing important skills for leadership, \u00a0including conflict management and transformation and leading change, trauma-informed leadership and the role of identity in the practice of ethical leadership.\u00a0 In these ways, the CTP seeks to equip professionals to be effective ethical leaders in challenging times",

The Vanderbilt Institute for Energy and Environment (VIEE) coordinated research and education that directly linked the social and behavioral sciences, physical sciences, engineering, law, education, public health, medicine, nursing, and policy. Specifically, the VIEE played a convening role in bringing together researchers who sought to elucidate the relationships among individual, institutional, and societal choices for energy production and use, and the impacts and benefits of these choices on the environment and health through links with climate, water quality, economics, social psychology, and natural resources. \n================================================================================\n\nScraped from: https://www.vanderbilt.edu/email/\nDate scraped: 2025-02-17 02:45:32",
