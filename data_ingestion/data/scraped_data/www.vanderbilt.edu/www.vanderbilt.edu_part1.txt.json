    "text": "The Center for Digital Humanities at Vanderbilt, 2016-2023   We are a technology lab, event venue, informal meeting space, and intellectual hub for digital humanities inquiry and practice that reaches across and beyond the Vanderbilt University campus. Skeptics, novices, and those with developed interests in digital scholarship are all welcome.  The phrase Digital Humanities (DH) is an umbrella term used to describe research, projects, public communication, and teaching at the intersection of digital technology and humanities research. A core principle of humanities scholarship holds that understanding the cultural record of human expression and human experience – literature, history, philosophy, arts and languages—can enrich the lives of all. Digital Humanities maintains a focus on human questions: enduring ones from ancient times and new ones brought to the fore by our digital lives today. At the same time, digital humanities expands and updates the practices of humanities scholarship. In addition to introducing new technologies to humanities research, such as computational text analysis, digital archives, or 3D modeling of virtual environments, the digital humanities introduce new modes and modalities of humanities research and communication",

    "text": ". The Center for Digital Humanities at Vanderbilt aims to create a flourishing environment for innovative exploration at the intersection of digital technology and humanities research by providing learning experiences, project support, and opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration. We are open to undergraduates, faculty, staff, doctoral students, postdocs, and the greater Nashville DH community. We promote public scholarship and partnership-building, and we serve as a point of contact for our members, connecting humanities researchers with partners at other institutions, with synergistic colleagues across campus, or within support areas like the libraries. Graduate education constitutes a core pillar of our mission. Through our fellowship program and digital working groups, we aim to introduce doctoral students from humanities departments across the University to a wealth of new skills and possibilities. We aim to ensure that a humanities PhD from Vanderbilt opens up a world of professional opportunities for Vanderbilt‘s graduate students, despite declining numbers of new professorial jobs in the humanities worldwide. For information on professional organizations and fellowships for graduate students, visit our resource guide . Our newly renovated space is equipped to support digital humanities research and experimentation.

Initiatives and Programs Immersion Vanderbilt calls for each undergraduate student to participate in an intensive learning experience that takes place in and beyond the classroom and culminates in the creation of an academic product. Students will engage in a civic and professional, creative expression, international, or research immersion experience. Examples include writing and producing a musical, studying the workings of cells in a lab, traveling to Guatemala to repair medical equipment, or working on a project designed to understand human behavior. Vanderbilt is committed to supporting and retaining outstanding faculty who have recently received tenure. The Chancellor Faculty Fellows represent the future of our institution. They offer energy and innovation for new basic discoveries, path breaking scholarship and creative expression. By investing in a select group of younger scholars from across the campus, Vanderbilt is helping to advance their careers at a critical time while providing a forum to share their academic interests with others on campus that build and enrich our One Vanderbilt community. By working to transform education models through technology and research, Vanderbilt will build on its international reputation",

History Settled in 1779 along the banks of the Cumberland River, Nashville became Tennessee’s state capital in 1843. Just 30 years later, Vanderbilt University was founded—marking the start of an enduring relationship between a dynamic Southern city and a world-class research institution. Climate Nashville’s climate is often characterized as mild, with colder winter months and high temperatures in the summer. Most of the city’s rain occurs during the spring, and if a snowfall does occur, it’s seldom heavy. Campus life at Vanderbilt benefits tremendously from the city’s temperate weather, as outdoor activities can typically occur throughout the academic year. Transportation While several restaurants and cultural attractions are within easy walking distance of Vanderbilt’s campus, ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft also are widely available throughout Nashville.

    "text": "Academic Integrity at Vanderbilt The Vanderbilt Honor System Since the first classes began at Vanderbilt in 1875, the Honor System has served to strengthen the academic integrity of the university. Today, the university’s Honor System is led by eight student-run councils. Each council serves to uphold and protect the Honor Code and to educate members of the Vanderbilt community about the importance of academic integrity. While the Undergraduate Honor Council is comprised of approximately 90 members representing all four undergraduate schools, each graduate and professional school houses its own graduate and/or professional student honor council. Each of these councils is responsible for adjudicating matters of academic dishonesty reported within their school or college. Students, faculty and staff should report suspected Honor Code violations involving undergraduate students by using the Honor Code Incident Reporting Form . Incidents involving graduate and professional students should be reported to the respective honor council. Contact information for each of the graduate and professional honor councils is available here . Statement of the Honor Code Vanderbilt University students pursue all academic endeavors with integrity. They conduct themselves honorably, professionally, and respectfully in all realms of their studies in order to promote and secure an atmosphere of dignity and trust",

    "text": "The Center for Digital Humanities The Center for Digital Humanities at Vanderbilt, 2016-2023   We are a technology lab, event venue, informal meeting space, and intellectual hub for digital humanities inquiry and practice that reaches across and beyond the Vanderbilt University campus. Skeptics, novices, and those with developed interests in digital scholarship are all welcome.  The phrase Digital Humanities (DH) is an umbrella term used to describe research, projects, public communication, and teaching at the intersection of digital technology and humanities research. A core principle of humanities scholarship holds that understanding the cultural record of human expression and human experience – literature, history, philosophy, arts and languages—can enrich the lives of all. Digital Humanities maintains a focus on human questions: enduring ones from ancient times and new ones brought to the fore by our digital lives today. At the same time, digital humanities expands and updates the practices of humanities scholarship. In addition to introducing new technologies to humanities research, such as computational text analysis, digital archives, or 3D modeling of virtual environments, the digital humanities introduce new modes and modalities of humanities research and communication",

Through our various programming, we offer opportunities for students, staff and faculty at Vanderbilt’s professional schools to develop their sense of professional vocation and ethical leadership.  In addition, we offer programs for the general public on subjects related to moral leadership within the professions. These offerings include conversations on justice and the common good, on addressing ethical issues relevant to the professions, and on developing important skills for leadership,  including conflict management and transformation and leading change, trauma-informed leadership and the role of identity in the practice of ethical leadership.  In these ways, the CTP seeks to equip professionals to be effective ethical leaders in challenging times",

Opportunity Vanderbilt makes it happen At Vanderbilt, we believe cost should never be a barrier to a world-class education. That’s why we provide a full-tuition scholarship for all households with income of $150K* or less. Also, many households with income of more than $150K still receive an Opportunity Vanderbilt Award . *assuming typical assets  Opening Doors for Future Commodores Through Opportunity Vanderbilt  Providing for college is one of the largest single investments a family will make, and we strongly believe that a Vanderbilt education is well worth the investment. Opportunity Vanderbilt reflects our belief that a world-renowned education should be accessible to all qualified students regardless of their economic circumstances. We make three important commitments to U.S. Citizens and eligible non-citizens to ensure that students from many different economic circumstances can enroll at Vanderbilt: Since talent and promise recognize no social, cultural, economic, or geographic boundaries, our admissions process is need-blind for U.S. Citizens and eligible non-citizens. Vanderbilt will meet 100% of a family’s demonstrated financial need. Financial aid awards do not include loans",

Instead of offering need-based loans to undergraduate students, Vanderbilt offers additional grant assistance. This does not involve income bands or \"cut-offs\" that impact or limit eligibility. Opportunity Vanderbilt's three commitments place Vanderbilt among a small number of U.S. universities to adopt these philosophies and allocate the resources necessary to make a premier college education a reality for students and their families. Vanderbilt University is committed to using the Principles & Standards of the College Cost Transparency Initiative in its student financial aid offer.",
