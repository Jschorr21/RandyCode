The CampusPrint program, in partnership with RJ Young, is now underway in select university areas. This new fleet copier/printer program provides a number of benefits to Vanderbilt University departments, including: Pay-per-use pricing model Secure printing using your Vanderbilt ID/Commodore Card Campus-wide access, giving you the ability to send and release your print job at any CampusPrint-enabled device Unlimited training and support Reduced administrative burden for departments - no individual leases, POs, or service agreements Energy-efficient machines Multi-function devices, combining copy, print, scan, and fax (most devices) in one machine For questions or more details about CampusPrint, please contact the CampusPrint team at: campusprint@vanderbilt.edu 615.936.4544 Paper is no longer included as part of the CampusPrint per-copy price.  As a result of this change, copy/print rates will not increase for FY24.
