Vanderbilt University recognizes that during an employee\u2019s career, circumstances may arise which require prolonged or intermittent absence from work due to medical reasons. Vanderbilt University provides its employees the family and medical leave guaranteed to eligible employees by federal and state law. The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) is a federal law that provides employees the right to take a leave of absence for personal or family medical reasons and leave for military families while maintaining job protection. An employee may start the application process for Family Medical Leave by completing the online Medical Leave Request\u00a0form . In the event an employee is not eligible for FMLA, this same form will start the application process for a Non-FMLA Medical Leave . Who Is My FMLA Contact?

The information on this site applies to hiring foreign nationals for faculty, research, and staff positions only, and applies to the H-1B, TN, O-1, and E-3 employment-based temporary worker visa categories as well as the permanent resident \"green card\" process.\u00a0 For information regarding foreign national student employees (F-1 and J-1), please contact International Student and Scholar Services (ISSS) .\u00a0 Additionally, this office handles only University immigration matters.\u00a0 All VUMC immigration matters are handled by VUMC Immigration Services Office",
