    "text": "Emergency Guides These brief guides provide instructions for some of the emergencies that may occur on or near the Vanderbilt University campus. The guides below cannot address every possible situation that may occur in all categories and can be adjusted to meet the needs of each individual situation. You may need additional information in the event of an actual emergency. Active Assailant Because an active assailant incident requires rapid response, the best time to consider how to react is in advance. By familiarizing yourself with your surroundings and possible escape routes and considering how you might react in such a situation, you can act quickly and more efficiently if the need arises. There are three options to consider if faced with an active assailant incident: Run , Hide , or – as a last resort – Fight , if your life is in imminent danger. RUN – If there is a way to escape the threat and you are reasonably sure you can do so without being harmed, do it. This is your first and best option. Be sure to: Have an escape route in mind. Evacuate regardless of if others agree to follow. Leave your belongings behind. (Keep your cell phone in your pocket.) Help others escape, especially those with special needs. Tell others not to enter the area where the active shooter may be. Keep your hands visible at all times. Follow the instructions of any law enforcement personnel. Do not attempt to move injured people",

Choose the best space that is available quickly. Your hiding place should: Be out of the view of the active shooter. Provide protection if shots are fired in your direction (i.e., lock or barricade a door by any means available). Not trap you or restrict your options for movement. To prevent an active shooter from entering your hiding place, you should: Turn off lights. Lock all doors and windows, if possible. Place heavy furniture or equipment in front of any doors (especially if the door does not lock or opens into the hallway). Close blinds, and cover and move away from windows. To keep yourself safe while hiding you should: Remain quiet. Hide behind large items (i.e., cabinets, desks). Silence your cell phone and turn off vibrate mode",

Don’t respond to voice commands or move barricades until you are sure that commands are coming from police. If you can speak to a dispatcher without being overheard by the assailants, Call Vanderbilt University Public Safety (VUPS) by dialing 615-421-1911 or Metro Nashville PD by dialing 911, to alert police to the situation. If you cannot speak, mute the speaker and leave the line open so the dispatcher can listen. VandySafe allows for text chat with dispatchers. Select the 'Contact VUPD' button then the 'Chat with VUPD' option. Do not approach emergency responders; let them come to you. If outside when a shooting occurs: Drop to the ground immediately, face down and as flat as possible. Move or crawl away from gunfire, trying to use any obstacle between you and the gunfire. Remember, obstacles may conceal you from sight, but may not be bulletproof. When you reach a safe place, stay down, do not move. Do not peek or raise your head to try to see what is happening. Wait and listen for further instructions from law enforcement personnel. FIGHT – Only as a last resort, if your life is in danger.

Notification of emergency personnel: Once you safely evacuate, notify emergency personnel immediately about any individuals remaining in the building and their locations. Carry Techniques To be used only in emergency situations where death or serious bodily injury is imminent. One-person Carry Technique (The Cradle Lift) The Cradle Lift is the preferred carry method when the person to be carried has little or no arm strength. It is safer if the person being carried weighs less than the carrier. Place one arm under the upper back and one arm under the knees",

Individuals With Mobility Limitations – Non-Wheelchair User Discuss needs and preferences: Ask if assistance is needed and what their specific needs are. Inquire if the person can evacuate using the stairs without help or with minor assistance. Ensure a clear path of travel: If debris is present, it may be necessary to clear a path to the nearest exit route. No imminent danger: If there is no imminent danger, the person may choose to remain in the building or to be directed to an area of refuge (stairwell) until emergency personnel arrive. Fire Department personnel, who are trained in emergency rescue, can then enter the building, and assist the person in exiting the building, either down the stairs or using the emergency elevator recall.

Supportive measures are available to both Complainants and Respondents to assist them as they move through the process (whether a Complainant files a Formal Complaint or not). Vanderbilt encourages anyone interested in supportive measures to reach out to the Title IX Office. It is not necessary to file a Formal Complaint or have a Formal Complaint filed against you in order to receive supportive measures. Student Resources Vanderbilt University seeks to maintain a safe and healthy environment for all students. We take reports of sexual misconduct and intimate partner violence seriously, and how we respond depends on, among other things, the facts and circumstances of the specific incident, the wishes of the victim, to whom it was reported, and the University’s obligations under applicable federal and state laws. The policies governing our investigative and adjudication processes may be found in the Sexual Misconduct Policy and Formal Grievance Protocol",
