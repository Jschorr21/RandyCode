The guides below cannot address every possible situation that may occur in all categories and can be adjusted to meet the needs of each individual situation. You may need additional information in the event of an actual emergency. Active Assailant Because an active assailant incident requires rapid response, the best time to consider how to react is in advance. By familiarizing yourself with your surroundings and possible escape routes and considering how you might react in such a situation, you can act quickly and more efficiently if the need arises. There are three options to consider if faced with an active assailant incident: Run , Hide , or \u2013 as a last resort \u2013 Fight , if your life is in imminent danger. RUN \u2013 If there is a way to escape the threat and you are reasonably sure you can do so without being harmed, do it. This is your first and best option. Be sure to: Have an escape route in mind. Evacuate regardless of if others agree to follow. Leave your belongings behind. (Keep your cell phone in your pocket.) Help others escape, especially those with special needs. Tell others not to enter the area where the active shooter may be. Keep your hands visible at all times. Follow the instructions of any law enforcement personnel. Do not attempt to move injured people",

Individuals With Mobility Limitations \u2013 Wheelchair User Discuss needs and preferences: Ask if assistance is needed and what their specific needs are. Non-ambulatory persons\u2019 needs and preferences vary widely, so it is crucial to ask how they would like to be assisted. Wheelchair-user on the ground floor: Individuals who use wheelchairs may choose to evacuate themselves from the ground floor with minimal assistance. Ensure a clear path of travel: If debris is present, it may be necessary to clear a path to the nearest exit. No imminent danger: If there is no imminent danger, the person may choose to remain in the building or to be directed to an area of refuge (stairwell) until emergency personnel arrive. Fire Department personnel, who are trained in emergency rescue, can then enter the building, and assist the person in exiting the building, either down the stairs or using the emergency elevator recall. Imminent danger: If danger is imminent and the individual does not wish to be removed from their wheelchair, direct the person to the nearest area of refuge (stairwell) and notify emergency personnel immediately",

While staying in place, the wheelchair user should keep in direct contact with VUPS Dispatch by dialing 615-421-1911 from a cell phone and reporting directly pertinent information including location. Carrying wheelchair users: Most wheelchairs are too heavy to carry down stairs. If the person wishes to be carried down the stairs without the wheelchair, ask about the best carry options, i.e., two-person cradle carry, office chair evacuation, or, if available, an evacuation chair. Mobility aids or devices: Return any mobility aids or devices to the person as soon as possible, ensuring they have the necessary support for mobility. Notification of emergency personnel: Once you safely evacuate, notify emergency personnel immediately about any individuals remaining in the building and their locations. Carry Techniques To be used only in emergency situations where death or serious bodily injury is imminent. One-person Carry Technique (The Cradle Lift) The Cradle Lift is the preferred carry method when the person to be carried has little or no arm strength. It is safer if the person being carried weighs less than the carrier. Place one arm under the upper back and one arm under the knees",

Reach under the individual\u2019s knees to grasp the wrist of carry partner\u2019s other hand. Both carry partners should then lean in close to the individual and lift on the count of three.

Consider the following suggestions when assisting individuals with disabilities in an emergency: Individuals Who Are Blind or Have Low Vision Describe the emergency: Provide clear and concise information about the emergency situation and the immediate surroundings. Offer assistance: Offer your arm for the individual to hold onto as you guide them to safety. Allow them to grasp your arm above your elbow, which provides stability and control. Provide details: Communicate verbally about the direction you are headed and any potential obstacles or hazards along the way. Be descriptive and specific. Orient the individual: Once at a safe location, provide orientation by describing the surroundings. Offer assistance and ensure the individual feels comfortable and informed before leaving. Individuals Who Are Deaf or Hard Of Hearing Alert the individual: Utilize visual alerts, such as flashing lights, or waving your arms. One may also tap an individual on the shoulder if visual cues are not effective. Communication: If Sign Language is not known, use gestures or written notes",

Inquire if the person can evacuate using the stairs without help or with minor assistance. Ensure a clear path of travel: If debris is present, it may be necessary to clear a path to the nearest exit route. No imminent danger: If there is no imminent danger, the person may choose to remain in the building or to be directed to an area of refuge (stairwell) until emergency personnel arrive. Fire Department personnel, who are trained in emergency rescue, can then enter the building, and assist the person in exiting the building, either down the stairs or using the emergency elevator recall.

Indoors: Alert building occupants of the impending weather. If you are in a classroom or meeting area, stop all non-emergency activities and seek shelter. Move quickly to a safe area. Move to the most interior portion (stairwell, hallway, or room) of the building on the lowest possible floor. Stay away from windows, doors, and exterior walls. Close all doors leading to exterior rooms \u2013 only if possible and necessary. Stay sheltered until the threat has passed. Monitor for more information and follow instructions from AlertVU messages. Remember, even when a specific storm cell has passed beyond the area, conditions may still be right for high winds, lightning, and other hazardous weather conditions.
