    "text": "Emergency Guides These brief guides provide instructions for some of the emergencies that may occur on or near the Vanderbilt University campus. The guides below cannot address every possible situation that may occur in all categories and can be adjusted to meet the needs of each individual situation. You may need additional information in the event of an actual emergency. Active Assailant Because an active assailant incident requires rapid response, the best time to consider how to react is in advance. By familiarizing yourself with your surroundings and possible escape routes and considering how you might react in such a situation, you can act quickly and more efficiently if the need arises. There are three options to consider if faced with an active assailant incident: Run , Hide , or – as a last resort – Fight , if your life is in imminent danger. RUN – If there is a way to escape the threat and you are reasonably sure you can do so without being harmed, do it. This is your first and best option. Be sure to: Have an escape route in mind. Evacuate regardless of if others agree to follow. Leave your belongings behind. (Keep your cell phone in your pocket.) Help others escape, especially those with special needs. Tell others not to enter the area where the active shooter may be. Keep your hands visible at all times. Follow the instructions of any law enforcement personnel. Do not attempt to move injured people",

Choose the best space that is available quickly. Your hiding place should: Be out of the view of the active shooter. Provide protection if shots are fired in your direction (i.e., lock or barricade a door by any means available). Not trap you or restrict your options for movement. To prevent an active shooter from entering your hiding place, you should: Turn off lights. Lock all doors and windows, if possible. Place heavy furniture or equipment in front of any doors (especially if the door does not lock or opens into the hallway). Close blinds, and cover and move away from windows.

If outside when a shooting occurs: Drop to the ground immediately, face down and as flat as possible. Move or crawl away from gunfire, trying to use any obstacle between you and the gunfire. Remember, obstacles may conceal you from sight, but may not be bulletproof. When you reach a safe place, stay down, do not move. Do not peek or raise your head to try to see what is happening.

Imminent danger: If danger is imminent and the individual does not wish to be removed from their wheelchair, direct the person to the nearest area of refuge (stairwell) and notify emergency personnel immediately. While staying in place, the wheelchair user should keep in direct contact with VUPS Dispatch by dialing 615-421-1911 from a cell phone and reporting directly pertinent information including location. Carrying wheelchair users: Most wheelchairs are too heavy to carry down stairs. If the person wishes to be carried down the stairs without the wheelchair, ask about the best carry options, i.e., two-person cradle carry, office chair evacuation, or, if available, an evacuation chair. Mobility aids or devices: Return any mobility aids or devices to the person as soon as possible, ensuring they have the necessary support for mobility. Notification of emergency personnel: Once you safely evacuate, notify emergency personnel immediately about any individuals remaining in the building and their locations. Carry Techniques To be used only in emergency situations where death or serious bodily injury is imminent. One-person Carry Technique (The Cradle Lift) The Cradle Lift is the preferred carry method when the person to be carried has little or no arm strength. It is safer if the person being carried weighs less than the carrier. Place one arm under the upper back and one arm under the knees",

Emergency Plans: Learn what to do in case of an emergency. Chat with Security: Communicate live with Vanderbilt Police Dispatchers via text chat. Campus safety resources: Access important safety resources in one convenient app. Because an active assailant incident requires rapid response, the best time to consider how to react is in advance. By familiarizing yourself with your surroundings and possible escape routes and considering how you might react in such a situation, you can act quickly and more efficiently if the need arises. There are three options to consider if faced with an active assailant incident: Run , Hide , or – as a last resort – Fight , if your life is in imminent danger. RUN – If there is a way to escape the threat and you are reasonably sure you can do so without being harmed, do it. This is your first and best option. Be sure to: Have an escape route in mind. Evacuate regardless of if others agree to follow. Leave your belongings behind",

Any individual can experience sexual misconduct, and these resources are available to all interested parties, regardless of whether they proceed with filing a formal complaint with the Title IX Office.

Sexual misconduct intersects with an individual’s identities and can affect how they respond to trauma, access help, make decisions about reporting, and move forward in their coping and healing. Both Complainants (people who are alleged to have experienced sexual misconduct) and Respondents (people who are alleged to have committed sexual misconduct) can find the sexual misconduct investigation process stressful and anxiety-inducing. Supportive measures are available to both Complainants and Respondents to assist them as they move through the process (whether a Complainant files a Formal Complaint or not). Vanderbilt encourages anyone interested in supportive measures to reach out to the Title IX Office. It is not necessary to file a Formal Complaint or have a Formal Complaint filed against you in order to receive supportive measures.
