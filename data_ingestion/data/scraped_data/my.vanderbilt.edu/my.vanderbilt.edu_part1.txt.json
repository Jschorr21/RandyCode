Skeptics, novices, and those with developed interests in digital scholarship are all welcome.  The phrase Digital Humanities (DH) is an umbrella term used to describe research, projects, public communication, and teaching at the intersection of digital technology and humanities research. A core principle of humanities scholarship holds that understanding the cultural record of human expression and human experience – literature, history, philosophy, arts and languages—can enrich the lives of all. Digital Humanities maintains a focus on human questions: enduring ones from ancient times and new ones brought to the fore by our digital lives today. At the same time, digital humanities expands and updates the practices of humanities scholarship. In addition to introducing new technologies to humanities research, such as computational text analysis, digital archives, or 3D modeling of virtual environments, the digital humanities introduce new modes and modalities of humanities research and communication",

Frist Center End-to-End Employment Pipeline Model The Frist Center for Autism and Innovation was formed from its inception in 2017 with the intention of serving as the core academic research partner within a larger, community-based effort to develop a truly end-to-end employment pipeline model. In this model, we seek to develop, demonstrate, and disseminate components necessary for a community to come together to create a robust series of pathways and opportunities that lead to meaningful employment for autistic individuals and that enhance the bottom line for the businesses. This “pipeline to employment” model helps the Frist Center identify roadblocks to meaningful employment faced by many individuals with autism and work with partners throughout the community to identify or develop programs and innovations that may help individuals succeed in overcoming these obstacles. There are a lot of unknowns in science, particularly when it comes to neurodiversity, but what is clear is many in the neurodiversity community are looking for employment help.

Once a program or innovation has been vetted, we incorporate it into the pipeline model. Simply put, the model is a collection of programs and innovations that help neurodiverse individuals understand their own talents, obtain appropriate training and upskilling (including soft skills) for workplace readiness through educational programs and novel assistive technologies, find meaningful employment, and land in workplaces that themselves have been trained in evidence-based management methods for true neuro-inclusion at work. The Social-Strengths Based Model of Neurodiversity The medical model of disability sees disability as an individual health condition or problem that needs to be fixed or cured. It focuses on diagnosing and treating the impairments or limitations that a person has, often through medical interventions such as surgeries, medications, or therapies. This model places the responsibility for addressing disability on the individual, rather than considering the role of societal barriers and attitudes",

In essence, it views the person as the problem that needs to be fixed, rather than recognizing and addressing the systemic and environmental factors that can limit their full participation in society. The social model of neurodiversity refers to the approach of understanding and accepting neurological differences, such as autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and others, as natural variations in the human brain. It seeks to move away from pathologizing these differences and instead focuses on providing support, accommodations, and acceptance to individuals with diverse neurological profiles. In essence, it encourages society to embrace and celebrate neurodiversity rather than trying to force everyone to fit into a narrow definition of \"normal.\" This model recognizes that each person's brain functions in unique ways and that such differences should be respected and valued. The strengths-based model of neurodiversity is an approach that focuses on identifying and leveraging the unique strengths and abilities of individuals with diverse neurological profiles, such as autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and others. Instead of viewing neurodivergent traits as deficits or challenges, this model emphasizes recognizing and nurturing the specific talents and capabilities that individuals possess",

It involves identifying and building on the strengths of each person, allowing them to contribute to society in meaningful and valuable ways. By emphasizing and celebrating the diverse strengths and abilities of neurodiverse individuals, this model aims to create a more inclusive and supportive environment where everyone's contributions are valued. At the Frist Center we work with a compounded model of the social and strengths based approach: the social-strengths model . This model seeks to employ the best parts of both models to enable success in all education and career stages for a neurodivergent individual. We note, we do not dismiss the medical model, and understand its utility in the neurodiverse community. The Double-Empathy Opportunity The double-empathy problem refers to the difficulty that people with different neurotypes (such as autistic and non-autistic individuals) may have in understanding each other's emotions and experiences. It suggests misunderstandings and communication barriers can occur because their neurotype influences each person's perception and expression of emotions. This concept highlights the importance of mutual empathy and understanding in bridging the gap between different neurotypes and improving communication and relationships",

    "text": "The Behavioral Wedge Home Team Biosketches Research Papers Press Release & News  What is the behavioral wedge? The behavioral wedge research program makes four major points: Household behavior can make a substantial difference in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  For the U.S. household sector, we have estimated Reasonably Achievable Emissions Reductions of 123 MtC.  This is equivalent to the emissions of France, or the total emissions of the petroleum refining, iron and steel and aluminum industries combined. Most of this potential comes from adoption of energy-efficient technologies; reduced use matters but does not have as much impact as choice of technologies. Voluntary action is important but not sufficient.  Policies and programs must be put in place that can overcome the main barriers to change. The barriers to change and principles for designing programs and policies are well known from past research, but they are rarely implemented as an integrated package.  As a result, programs that feature information, financial incentives, or other important elements have varied in effectiveness by a factor of 10 or more depending on details of implementation Programs and policies could have far greater impact if they adopt the best principles of program design",

As the name suggests, the program pairs undergraduate mentees with graduate mentors who work through a semester-long independent study project together. That project is usually based on a particular book or article, which the mentee reads at their own pace while the mentor guides and supplements the reading. The first DRP was started at the University of Chicago in 2003 and now exists at many universities across the country. The DRP Network has been established to connect these programs and to provide resources for their success. Who are the mentees? Mentees are motivated undergraduate students who might… wish to learn about a subject not covered by the department coursework. want an in-depth analysis of a particular topic. like math but want to learn more about what math “is”. want to see a more advanced treatment of a standard subject. want to develop the skill of working independently through a topic. want to improve their ability to communicate, especially technically. Who are the mentors? Mentors are motivated math PhD students/postdocs who might… be interested in sharing their passion for math. want to learn valuable mentorship skills. wish to learn a new topic through their mentorship.
