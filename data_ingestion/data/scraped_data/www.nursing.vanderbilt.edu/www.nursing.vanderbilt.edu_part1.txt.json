Madeline Broming, Mollie Gurley, Hannah Wright and a fourth student who wishes to remain anonymous were part of a highly competitive application process with nearly 2,500 entries from more than 700 schools across the country.  Just under 10 percent of applicants received the scholarship award this year. NURSE Corps is a loan repayment and scholarship opportunity from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Health Resources and Services Administration.  The program, established in 2002, helps to build healthier communities in urban, rural and frontier areas by supporting nurses and nursing students committed to working in communities with inadequate access to care.
