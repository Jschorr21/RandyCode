The guides below cannot address every possible situation that may occur in all categories and can be adjusted to meet the needs of each individual situation. You may need additional information in the event of an actual emergency. Active Assailant Because an active assailant incident requires rapid response, the best time to consider how to react is in advance. By familiarizing yourself with your surroundings and possible escape routes and considering how you might react in such a situation, you can act quickly and more efficiently if the need arises. There are three options to consider if faced with an active assailant incident: Run , Hide , or – as a last resort – Fight , if your life is in imminent danger. RUN – If there is a way to escape the threat and you are reasonably sure you can do so without being harmed, do it. This is your first and best option. Be sure to: Have an escape route in mind. Evacuate regardless of if others agree to follow. Leave your belongings behind. (Keep your cell phone in your pocket.) Help others escape, especially those with special needs. Tell others not to enter the area where the active shooter may be. Keep your hands visible at all times. Follow the instructions of any law enforcement personnel. Do not attempt to move injured people",

Choose the best space that is available quickly. Your hiding place should: Be out of the view of the active shooter. Provide protection if shots are fired in your direction (i.e., lock or barricade a door by any means available). Not trap you or restrict your options for movement. To prevent an active shooter from entering your hiding place, you should: Turn off lights. Lock all doors and windows, if possible. Place heavy furniture or equipment in front of any doors (especially if the door does not lock or opens into the hallway). Close blinds, and cover and move away from windows.

Inquire how best to assist the individual and whether any precautionary measures need to be taken or items need to accompany the person. Consider the following suggestions when assisting individuals with disabilities in an emergency: Individuals Who Are Blind or Have Low Vision Describe the emergency: Provide clear and concise information about the emergency situation and the immediate surroundings. Offer assistance: Offer your arm for the individual to hold onto as you guide them to safety. Allow them to grasp your arm above your elbow, which provides stability and control. Provide details: Communicate verbally about the direction you are headed and any potential obstacles or hazards along the way. Be descriptive and specific. Orient the individual: Once at a safe location, provide orientation by describing the surroundings. Offer assistance and ensure the individual feels comfortable and informed before leaving. Individuals Who Are Deaf or Hard Of Hearing Alert the individual: Utilize visual alerts, such as flashing lights, or waving your arms. One may also tap an individual on the shoulder if visual cues are not effective. Communication: If Sign Language is not known, use gestures or written notes",

Indicate directions with gestures or write a note with evacuation instructions. Individuals With Mobility Limitations – Non-Wheelchair User Discuss needs and preferences: Ask if assistance is needed and what their specific needs are. Inquire if the person can evacuate using the stairs without help or with minor assistance. Ensure a clear path of travel: If debris is present, it may be necessary to clear a path to the nearest exit route. No imminent danger: If there is no imminent danger, the person may choose to remain in the building or to be directed to an area of refuge (stairwell) until emergency personnel arrive. Fire Department personnel, who are trained in emergency rescue, can then enter the building, and assist the person in exiting the building, either down the stairs or using the emergency elevator recall. Imminent danger: If danger is imminent, use a sturdy chair, with or without wheels, to move the person, or help carry the person to safety using a carry technique, or, if available, use an evacuation chair. Mobility aids or devices: Return any mobility aids or devices to the person as soon as possible. Notification of emergency personnel: Once you safely evacuate, notify emergency personnel immediately about any individuals remaining in the building and their locations",

By familiarizing yourself with your surroundings and possible escape routes and considering how you might react in such a situation, you can act quickly and more efficiently if the need arises. There are three options to consider if faced with an active assailant incident: Run , Hide , or – as a last resort – Fight , if your life is in imminent danger. RUN – If there is a way to escape the threat and you are reasonably sure you can do so without being harmed, do it. This is your first and best option. Be sure to: Have an escape route in mind.

If you observe a person with a disability having difficulty evacuating, remember to ask if assistance is needed before acting. Inquire how best to assist the individual and whether any precautionary measures need to be taken or items need to accompany the person. Consider the following suggestions when assisting individuals with disabilities in an emergency: Individuals Who Are Blind or Have Low Vision Describe the emergency: Provide clear and concise information about the emergency situation and the immediate surroundings. Offer assistance: Offer your arm for the individual to hold onto as you guide them to safety. Allow them to grasp your arm above your elbow, which provides stability and control. Provide details: Communicate verbally about the direction you are headed and any potential obstacles or hazards along the way. Be descriptive and specific. Orient the individual: Once at a safe location, provide orientation by describing the surroundings. Offer assistance and ensure the individual feels comfortable and informed before leaving. Individuals Who Are Deaf or Hard Of Hearing Alert the individual: Utilize visual alerts, such as flashing lights, or waving your arms. One may also tap an individual on the shoulder if visual cues are not effective. Communication: If Sign Language is not known, use gestures or written notes",

Indicate directions with gestures or write a note with evacuation instructions. Individuals With Mobility Limitations – Non-Wheelchair User Discuss needs and preferences: Ask if assistance is needed and what their specific needs are. Inquire if the person can evacuate using the stairs without help or with minor assistance. Ensure a clear path of travel: If debris is present, it may be necessary to clear a path to the nearest exit route. No imminent danger: If there is no imminent danger, the person may choose to remain in the building or to be directed to an area of refuge (stairwell) until emergency personnel arrive. Fire Department personnel, who are trained in emergency rescue, can then enter the building, and assist the person in exiting the building, either down the stairs or using the emergency elevator recall. Imminent danger: If danger is imminent, use a sturdy chair, with or without wheels, to move the person, or help carry the person to safety using a carry technique, or, if available, use an evacuation chair. Mobility aids or devices: Return any mobility aids or devices to the person as soon as possible. Notification of emergency personnel: Once you safely evacuate, notify emergency personnel immediately about any individuals remaining in the building and their locations",

Any individual can experience sexual misconduct, and these resources are available to all interested parties, regardless of whether they proceed with filing a formal complaint with the Title IX Office.

Sexual misconduct intersects with an individual’s identities and can affect how they respond to trauma, access help, make decisions about reporting, and move forward in their coping and healing. Both Complainants (people who are alleged to have experienced sexual misconduct) and Respondents (people who are alleged to have committed sexual misconduct) can find the sexual misconduct investigation process stressful and anxiety-inducing. Supportive measures are available to both Complainants and Respondents to assist them as they move through the process (whether a Complainant files a Formal Complaint or not). Vanderbilt encourages anyone interested in supportive measures to reach out to the Title IX Office. It is not necessary to file a Formal Complaint or have a Formal Complaint filed against you in order to receive supportive measures.
