Test Case 1
Answer Relevancy: 0.57
Reason: The score is 0.57 because several irrelevant statements addressed specific components of the AXLE curriculum without connecting them to its overall application for students. While these details are informative, they fail to answer the core question about how AXLE affects students' educational experience, preventing the score from being higher.

Faithfulness: 0.92
Reason: The score is 0.92 because the actual output incorrectly claims that the AXLE Writing Requirement has four components, while the retrieval context states that it only includes English 1100 or a demonstration of basic skills.

Contextual Recall: 1.0
Reason: The score is 1.00 because every aspect of the expected output seamlessly corresponds with the retrieval context, confirming AXLE's role in providing a well-rounded education through detailed course requirements and skills development.

Contextual Relevancy: 0.49
Reason: The score is 0.49 because while there are relevant statements such as 'AXLE is the acronym for Achieving eXcellence in Liberal Education.' and 'It is the core curriculum that all students in the College of Arts and Science must fulfill.', the majority of the retrieval context comprises incomplete or off-topic information that doesn't address the specifics about how AXLE applies to students. For example, many statements focus on counseling procedures and courses rather than explaining the curriculum directly, resulting in a lower relevancy score.

Task Completion: 0.9
Reason: The response provided a thorough overview of the AXLE curriculum, including key components and guidance for students, closely aligning with the user's goal of understanding the curriculum. However, it may not have covered every detail or requirement comprehensively.

Correctness (GEval): 0.67
Reason: The actual output accurately describes the AXLE curriculum and includes key components such as the Writing Requirement and the Liberal Arts Requirement. However, it omits mention of the Mathematics and Natural Sciences and the Major Requirement, leading to a slight detail omission compared to the expected output.

Answer Relevancy: 1.0
Reason: The score is 1.00 because the response provided relevant information regarding study abroad opportunities for Vanderbilt undergraduates without including any irrelevant statements.

Faithfulness: 0.91
Reason: The score is 0.91 because the actual output inaccurately states that Vanderbilt has more than 120 approved study abroad programs, conflicting with the retrieval context, which indicates there are approximately thirty programs specifically for engineering or computer science courses.

Contextual Recall: 1.0
Reason: The score is 1.00 because every aspect of the expected output perfectly aligns with the information provided in the node(s) in retrieval context, confirming the range and details of Vanderbilt's study abroad opportunities.

Contextual Relevancy: 0.43
Reason: The score is 0.43 because the retrieval context largely contains information unrelated to the input question about study abroad opportunities, emphasizing topics like honors programs, medical courses, and student research. Relevant statements such as 'Vanderbilt offers study programs for all undergraduate students' and 'Vanderbilt's Global Education Office offers approximately thirty programs' provide the necessary context, but they are significantly outnumbered by irrelevant content.

Task Completion: 0.95
Reason: The actual outcome provides comprehensive information about study abroad programs available for Vanderbilt undergraduates, detailing the variety of options and specific areas of study, which closely aligns with the user's inquiry.

Correctness (GEval): 0.85
Reason: The actual output provides thorough details about study abroad programs, including specific offerings by school and financial aid, aligning closely with the expected output. It omits explicit mention of meeting with academic advisers, which would enhance completeness.

Answer Relevancy: 0.92
Reason: The score is 0.92 because there was a mention of the Immersion Vanderbilt website, which, while relevant to the topic, did not directly address the specifics of the program's impact on graduation requirements. This slight deviation from the core question prevented a higher score, but the main aspects of the inquiry were ultimately well-covered, justifying the strong relevancy.

Faithfulness: 0.83
Reason: The score is 0.83 because the actual output inaccurately claims that Immersion Vanderbilt is a graduation requirement for all undergraduates, while the context only specifies that at least one immersive experience is required, which is less stringent. Additionally, it misrepresents the requirement for the culminating project, suggesting a specific alignment with pathways that is not clearly stated in the context.

Contextual Recall: 1.0
Reason: The score is 1.00 because every statement in the expected output is well-supported by the information found in node 1 of the retrieval context, confirming a perfect alignment.

Contextual Relevancy: 0.47
Reason: The score is 0.47 because, although there are relevant details about Immersion Vanderbilt such as 'Immersion Vanderbilt is a requirement for all undergraduates' and 'Students must complete at least one immersive experience', the majority of the context is filled with unrelated statements regarding course specifics and processes that do not pertain to the impact of Immersion Vanderbilt on graduation requirements.

Task Completion: 0.9
Reason: The actual outcome provided a clear definition of Immersion Vanderbilt and its significance as a graduation requirement, closely aligning with the user's goal of understanding its impact on graduation requirements.

Correctness (GEval): 0.77
Reason: The actual output accurately describes Immersion Vanderbilt and its components, but it omits details such as the note that completion is not required for the project to be based on the immersive experience and other specific project forms. There is minimal contradiction with the expected output.

Answer Relevancy: 0.78
Reason: The score is 0.78 because while there are relevant details about study abroad opportunities, the presence of several procedural and call-to-action statements detracts from the core information requested. The output includes information not directly related to the actual opportunities available, preventing a higher score.

Faithfulness: 0.83
Reason: The score is 0.83 because the actual output overstates the number of Vanderbilt-approved study abroad programs by claiming more than 120, while the retrieval context indicates there are approximately thirty. Additionally, while the output implies that the Blair School of Music coordinates multiple study abroad programs with music degrees, the context specifies only five such programs.

Contextual Recall: 1.0
Reason: The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output is fully supported by corresponding nodes in the retrieval context, such as the offerings from the Global Education Office and details about financial aid and academic advising.

Contextual Relevancy: 0.39
Reason: The score is 0.39 because the retrieval context primarily discusses various unrelated academic programs and general information rather than directly addressing specific study abroad opportunities for Vanderbilt undergraduates. Relevant statements do exist, detailing 'Vanderbilt offers study programs for all undergraduate students...' and 'Blair: Five Vanderbilt study abroad programs are coordinated...', but they are overshadowed by extensive irrelevant content discussing projects, honors programs, and internships.

Task Completion: 1.0
Reason: The system provided comprehensive information on study abroad opportunities specifically for Vanderbilt undergraduates, fully addressing the user's inquiry.

Correctness (GEval): 0.78
Reason: The actual output provides detailed information about study abroad opportunities and includes specific programs like Semester & Year Abroad and the Visage Program, which the expected output also mentions, albeit in a slightly different format. However, it omits the mention of the Immersion Vanderbilt requirement and the need to consult with an academic adviser, leading to a slight penalization.

Answer Relevancy: 0.92
Reason: The score is 0.92 because while the main requirements for the Computer Science major were addressed, there was an irrelevant mention of Introduction to Engineering, which pertains to a different major. This slightly lowers the relevancy, but overall, most of the provided information was pertinent to the question asked.

Faithfulness: 0.85
Reason: The score is 0.85 because the actual output inaccurately claims that an Introduction to Engineering is a requirement, while the retrieval context does not mention it. Additionally, it states that the Computer Science Depth requirement is for 15 hours, which is not confirmed by the context that only categorizes it without specifying hours.

Contextual Recall: 1.0
Reason: The score is 1.00 because every aspect of the expected output is fully supported by corresponding details in the retrieval context, confirming a perfect alignment with the information provided in all relevant nodes.

Contextual Relevancy: 0.53
Reason: The score is 0.53 because while there are relevant statements like 'Curriculum Requirements for a B.S. in computer science requires a minimum of 120 hours' and 'Mathematics (17-19 hours) is a required component for the Computer Science major,' many statements in the retrieval context remain irrelevant, focusing instead on unrelated course substitutions, Liberal Arts Core, and other majors which do not clearly outline the specific requirements for the Computer Science Major.

Task Completion: 1.0
Reason: The actual outcome provides a comprehensive breakdown of the requirements for the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Major at Vanderbilt University, fully aligning with the user's goal.

Correctness (GEval): 0.62
Reason: The actual output provides a detailed breakdown of the requirements, closely matching the expected output, but it omits the detailed listing of advanced science courses and the Writing Component requirement, resulting in a loss of specificity.
