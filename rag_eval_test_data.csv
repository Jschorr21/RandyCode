must be included from the Liberal Arts Core (#4), Technical Electives (#9), or Open Electives (#10).
Undergraduates in computer science may apply the pass/fail option only to courses taken as open electives, technical electives, or part of the liberal arts core, subject to the school requirements for pass/fail."
"What is the AXLE curriculum, and how does it apply to students in the College of Arts and Science?","AXLE (Achieving eXcellence in Liberal Education) is the general education curriculum for the College of Arts and Science. It is designed to provide students with a broad foundation of knowledge while allowing flexibility to explore their academic interests. The curriculum includes:

First-Year Writing Seminar (FYW): Required course in the first year
Writing Requirement: Additional coursework to strengthen writing skills
Liberal Arts Requirement (13 courses total): Distributed across six different areas of study including: Humanities and Creative Arts (HCA)
International Cultures (INT)
History and Culture of the United States (US)
Mathematics and Natural Sciences (MNS)
Social and Behavioral Sciences (SBS)
Perspectives (P)
Major Requirement: Students must declare a major and complete its specific coursework
AXLE ensures that students develop critical thinking, communication skills, and interdisciplinary knowledge, which are essential for any career path​."
What study abroad opportunities are available for Vanderbilt undergraduates?,"Vanderbilt offers a wide range of study abroad opportunities through its Global Education Office (GEO). These include:

Vanderbilt-Approved Programs: Students can choose from over 120 programs in 40+ countries
Semester, Yearlong, and Summer Programs: Options for different durations to fit student schedules
Immersion Vanderbilt: Some programs align with the Immersion requirement, allowing students to gain international experience as part of their academic program
Financial Aid and Credit Transfer: Many programs allow students to use their Vanderbilt financial aid, and courses often count toward their degree requirements
Students interested in studying abroad should meet with an academic adviser and GEO staff to ensure credits align with their major or minor​."
"What is Immersion Vanderbilt, and how does it impact graduation requirements?","Immersion Vanderbilt is an undergraduate program designed to enhance learning through hands-on, experiential opportunities. It is a graduation requirement for all Vanderbilt undergraduates, meaning each student must complete at least one immersive experience followed by a culminating project.

To fulfill the Immersion Vanderbilt requirement, students must engage in an immersive experience in one of six pathways:

Research
Study Abroad
Innovation, Arts, & Design
Civic & Community Engagement
Leadership & Professional Development
Internships

Each immersive experience must be mentored by a faculty or staff member and should encourage reflection on the student’s learning and goals.

After completing an immersive experience, students develop a culminating project, which can take various forms, such as presentations, performances, prototypes, or written reports. While students are encouraged to base their culminating project on their immersive experience, it is not required.

Once the faculty adviser approves the culminating project, the Immersion Vanderbilt requirement is marked as complete, and the student’s degree audit and transcript are updated with the project title and pathway.
