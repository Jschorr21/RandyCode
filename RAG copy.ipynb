In a\\nliberal arts education, content is always considered in its larger context. Thus, the reflective and discursive aspects\\nof study in the liberal arts call upon students to move beyond the mere acquisition of information to inquire into the\\ndeeper issues within their studies, and to connect their learning across disciplines and cultures as they live and work\\nin the communal environment of Vanderbilt. The end product of a successful liberal arts education is a thoughtful\\ncitizen who is prepared to take up his or her rights and responsibilities in a democratic society, to analyze and\\ncritique received information, to articulate the issues at hand or the personal values at stake, and whose intellectual\\nlife is marked by ongoing internal dialogue about the quality and meaning of life for him or her, as well as for the\\ncommunity at large.\\nFear No Learning!\\nThe interdisciplinary inclination of many courses in the College of Arts and Science is an ideal training ground for\\nlearning new methodologies for problem solving in the complex, global world of the 21st century.

The small-group nature of these seminars allows for direct student-faculty interaction that stresses\\ntraining in techniques of scholarly inquiry. The students’ written work and oral presentations are subject to\\nthoughtful critical review by the faculty member, providing feedback that can be used to reconsider the manner in\\nwhich they articulate their ideas and to refine their skills in these areas.

Cultural anthropology examines the relationships, beliefs, values, and political-economic\\npractices that shape individual behavior, community life, and power in modern societies.

Our courses\\nemphasize creative and critical approaches to learning. The department of art offers a rigorous, socially minded,\\nand research-driven curriculum. Students engage in an immersive laboratory of fearless experimentation and\\nchallenge the rapidly expanding role of art in our society. Through trans-disciplinary thinking and experimental\\nmethodologies, students utilize a range of artistic disciplines in a state-of-the-art facility. Equal emphasis is placed\\non both individual and collective exploration, where students are encouraged to develop relationships across the\\nuniversity and broader communities.\\nMany students will use the program in art as a foundation for careers in which creativity and visual studies are\\nespecially valued, as the basis for advanced training in professional schools (such as art, architecture, museum\\nstudies), and for employment in galleries, museums, commercial art, or design-related fields.

The program provides a strong engineering background centered on digital\\ntechnology combined with an understanding of the principles and techniques of computer science. Computer\\nengineering is design-oriented. The basic principles of engineering and computer science are applied to the task at\\nhand, which may be the design of a digital processor, processor peripheral, or a complete digital processor-based\\nPage 340 of 1019',\n",

The curriculum includes requirements in the basic\\nsciences, mathematics, and humanities; a primary core of hardware and software courses; and a set of electives\\nthat combine breadth and depth requirements as described below. Students who major in computer engineering\\nwho wish to apply for graduate study in electrical engineering or computer science are encouraged strongly to\\nselect their elective courses to demonstrate depth in that particular area; the structure of the program enables that\\noption. The course of study leads to a bachelor of engineering.\\nUndergraduate Honors Program. With faculty approval, junior and senior students may be accepted into the Honors\\nProgram. To achieve honors status, the student must:\\n1. achieve and maintain a minimum GPA of 3.5.\\n2. complete 3 hours of undergraduate research (ECE 3860, 3861 or CS 3860, 3861) with final written report\\n3. complete 6 hours of ECE program elective credit from the following list:\\na. up to 3 additional hours of undergraduate research (ECE 3860, 3861 or CS 3860, 3861), or',\n",

Many students choose a program of study in engineering\\nmanagement, communication of science and technology, various engineering concentrations, environmental\\nscience or materials science; however, students may develop unique plans of study to specialize in areas for which\\nfacilities and faculty competence exist but which are not covered within a single existing degree program at\\nVanderbilt. Engineering science graduates may establish careers in engineering or science, interface with engineers\\n(e.g., in marketing and sales), or use their analytical and problem-solving skills to build future professional careers.\\nDefined areas of concentration exist in engineering management, communication of science and technology,\\nsecondary education, and materials science and engineering. Individual programs have been developed for students\\ninterested in careers in engineering mathematics, environmental engineering, transportation engineering, teaching,\\ntechnical communications, and other areas requiring nontraditional combinations of engineering courses.

It enables students to develop breadth and expertise in the history and theory of\\narchitecture, landscape architecture, and constructed environments; design studies; and theoretical and historical\\napproaches to analyzing urban scale and city planning. Students can build a foundation for graduate work in these\\nfields as well as for spatially related specializations in cognate disciplines such as anthropology, political science,\\npublic policy, sociology, demography, public health, environmental studies, civil engineering, computer science, and\\ngeography and geographic information systems.\\nCourse work is distributed as follows:\\n1. A 1000-level course (3 credit hours): Students must complete one 1000-level survey course in history of art\\nor architecture selected from HART 1100, 1105, 1120, 1121, 1122, 1200, 1205, 1210W, 1220, 1300, 1330W,\\n1400, 1740W, or CLAS 1020.
